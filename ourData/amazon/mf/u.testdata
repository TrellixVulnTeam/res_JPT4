7721.0,510,1.0,"Update Nov 2016 I continue to wonder why Intuit made the budget changes they did. I'm now forced to use some data from Quicken coupled with a lot of manual calculations and external data. It's just a mess. Why oh why doesn't some other company come out with a competing product.  Update Feb 2016 I HATE Quicken budgeting. Even after using the 2014 version for over 2 years I still find it a royal pain to deal with. All I need is one simple change to make it much better for me. That would be to show the total budget column on the right side of the Budget Details display. Without that I have to switch between two screens and use a calculator for each row of my budget. This was SO much easier in the 2011 version.  Original Review: I have Quicken 2014 Premier. I've used Quicken since about 1991. The previous version I was using was the 2011 version which was fine and worked much like the previous several versions. But in 2012 Quicken radically changed the budget feature (I mean really why do you use an individual tool like Quicken - budgeting right!) and broke it totally. User complaints were loud and clear demanding Intuit change back to the 2011 format. All Intuit did was continue to tweak the newer, less appreciated, format.  I managed to hold onto Quicken 2011 until recently. Quicken forces updates every three years by cutting off your bank downloads when your Quicken version is older than 3 years old.  It took me several hours to tame the new budget format into something I can use, but it is still very frustrating for me. Generally what Intuit did was remove manual user control over budgets, which killed budgets for most people that use Quicken. They then began to add back in features they had removed, but still in the new less useful format.  Today I can get budgets to work for me but every single day I have more effort involved than I did in Quicken 2011. I'm forced to switch between two or three different screen displays to do what I could do with one display before. I also have to have a pen and paper on the desk to write down some numbers between screen swaps. In some cases I have to have a calculator available too. For me it's a mess.  I've turned in feature / bug reports but hundreds of others have as well with no results. Intuit is just going down it's own path and ignoring customer inputs.",641

However if you are on Windows 7, please do not buy Windows 8 or 8.1 to replace your Windows 7 machine. Along with the lost WEI or the backup you lose the start menu, Aero effects, native DVD playback and several things have changed to make the OS more troublesome to use.

I will note that you should buy from Amazon directly, not from a seller as it is easy to buy from someone who is not selling a genuine copy.  Those are OEM system builders and while these OS's are tied to the same motherboard i suggest getting these instead of a W8 machine or a copy of W8. Your best bet is to build your own machine, there are tutorials on how to build your own PC and you will have a good chance of saving yourself from a headache, i mean unless of course you happened to like W8 or 8.1 in a store promoting that. I am offering an alternative for those that are too scared to use Windows 8 or 8.1.  There are a few good things about Windows 8/8.1 like multiple apps running side by side, new task manager, and a fast boot. You can also tweak the OS so you can have a start menu by searching for 'classic shell' or 'start menu for Windows 8'. Be aware though that it is not 100% safe as you do not want to download any programs without having an Antivirus protection and listen out to the negative reviews as they can be helpful in making the decision of sticking with Windows 8/8.1.",1116

If you like the look of the Windows versions, be prepared for a shock - Mac's version is completely different.  Claims to convert QIF files from Windows to Mac which it does -- too bad the end result is nothing like what you previously had.  Loses figures and accounts quicker than you can blink an eye or will mistake one entry for another because the entry code is different from Windows to Mac (for no apparent reason).

12633.0,496,3.0,"As a user of Peachtree that switched to Quickbooks beacause it was so clunky and my accountant hated Peachtree and used Quickbooks, I find this version to be at least usable.  The interface is much improved. I prefer Quickbooks for the reports, intuitiveness, export to Excel, online banking, and much reduced ad pitching. For my use, QB is far superior in these aspects and I can quickly fire of an accountants version of my books for the accountant to work his magic on and then easily reintegrate his changes. These things weren't as good for my purposes in Sage 50.  I also prefer the predetermined business templates in QB.  That said, if Sage were all I knew and my accountant actually used it and didn't grumble when had to give him paper copies rather than a digital file, I would think it an acceptable solution for a simple small business. As it has an adequate charting engine, the budgeting features are sufficent, and the standard reports are as one would expect.  Tech support is good for both companies.  I also prefer how QB doesn't beat me up with emails and phone calls when the newest version comes out.  Sage (Peachtree) was relentless about it if I didn't have their maintenance agreement for tech support and upgrades. QB sends little reminders every once in a while or lets you know of the new features in new version on the initial popup window upon opening. That said, this is knowledge from about 2 years ago with Sage (Peachtree), I can't speak to the new Sage until the initial year is up.  Essentially, it will come down to preference in the interface and what files the accountant can take for each user.",1464

2568.0,128,2.0,"The software does a decent job of backing up data and imaging disks. However, in my case, I bought it for its advertised Startup Recovery Manager which is supposed to allow you to restore your PC's system state in the event its startup files get corrupted. Unfortunately, it did not work as advertised. When I contacted tech support about this issue by email, I received the following response:  ""Please note that it's not possible to restore system state backup that way. In order to restore it, you need to run Acronis True Image 11 Home in Windows Environment, then choose this backup archive from Acronis Secure Zone and proceed with restoration.""  If I could start my PC in a Windows environment, I wouldn't need to restore the system state, now would I? Acronis Tech support appears to be staffed by a bunch of leftover Soviet bureaucrats who just don't get the job done.  The Secure Zone and Startup Recovery Manager flat don't work on my PC - even though Acronis says the software is compatible with Windows 2000. I spent hours testing it today. The worst news is that in a couple of instances, Startup Recovery Manager says it completed restoration of test files, when in fact, it did not. So, if you're going to rely on this product to recover your data, you'd better test it thoroughly before you actually need it.  If you just need disk imaging and data backup, this software will probably be OK. If you're looking for a comprehensive PC data recovery solution, you'll be better off looking somewhere else!",477

Most of the time I use Adobe Premier Pro and sometimes Sony Vegas.  No matter what I tried in this version, it just didn't seem to work.  I tried to get film off of two different video cameras, one a Sony and one a Canon.  No matter what I tried none of the videos would come in with sound.  I could take the same videos into QuickTime and Adobe Premier Pro and they worked perfectly.  I also tried to basic green screen editing and it was next to impossible.  When I finally did get a video to save out, the sound I played on screen was actually slightly off in the saved file.  Aside from these issues, there were a few notable program crashes along the way.  For now, I don't recommend it.

The protection on my Android device is pretty basic but I'll take what I can get. Norton 360 seems to protect really well. Since I've installed the software, it has protected me against two very serious threats.

I find that there really is no need to buy the more expensive version, this product does schedule C for my business and home office. I used the Home and Business last year and quite frankly found very little difference in the product. Annoyingly, Turbo Tax kept asking me to upgrade.  This year I knew that e-filing would cost and I gladly paid for it since I was afraid of the IRS's human/scan error in transcribing and I only paid $29 for Turbo Tax with State this year from Amazon.  Received my State Refund in a week, and I my Federal Refund in 2 weeks. No extra costs, deposited right into my bank account.

In the past, I have used McAfee (for a very short time), and Norton but none of them have been as effective at stopping threats, spam, etc. like Kaspersky has. For me, it has blocked thousands of website banners and advertisements, a good amount of spam, as well as a few viruses and Trojans here and there from malicious emails. I highly recommend it and will definitely renew at the end of my second year with the company.

2737.0,133,5.0,"I'm very pleased with the size and quality of the product.  It's tiny, with just enough of the unit exposed so that it can be easily grasped and removed.  It performs quite well with a good range (I was able to walk anywhere in a 15x15 room without loss of connectivity).  The product does come with a CD that contains both the basic drivers as well as the application that I needed to make this headset work with Skype on my Windows XP machine.  If I may offer a tip for fellow Skype users to help reduce frustration:  Insert the dongle into the USB slot & allow XP to install the drivers.  Then, go to the CD & install the BTW utility that applies to your operating system.  If the CD doesn't auto-run, just open the drive via My Computer & double click on the index.html icon.  It will walk you though several options, including pairing a headset.  Finally, go into Skype's audio settings (Tools/Options/Audio Settings) and choose blue tooth from the drop down lists for microphone, speakers, ringing, what ever you want to work through the headset.  I have had to re-select the Bluetooth option in Skype each time I shut down my PC.  I believe that is an issue with Skype though & not an issue really related in any way to the dongle.  It's a painless 3 clicks, so it's not a huge deal in my opinion.  I'm really glad that I bought it based both on the performance & the fact that it was a third of the cost of similar items sold in local stores.",293

9091.0,582,5.0,"I've used prior versions of CorelDRAW, most recently (and somewhat obviously) X6.  X7 represents a substantial upgrade.  I'm running the software on a machine I built that has an AMD FX-8320 processor.  That's an eight-core processor with 64-bit capability that runs at 3.5 ghz.  I've got it paired with 8gb of low latency Crucial memory.  The program resides on an SSD.  X7 launches almost instantly, and even with large files, it runs smooth as silk on this setup.  Corel actively supports this software.  On June 16, Corel released the X7.1 update, which is downloadable from their website for free.  (You have to have started at least a standard Corel account.  X7 requires that you start at least a free standard account in order to use templates and receive certain other benefits.  You can upgrade to a premium account, but that costs extra.)  I'm still toying around with this new X7.1 update.  In addition to general stability fixes, the main features it adds are the ability to customize elements of user interface (e.g., colors of borders and dialog boxes, location of status bar) and enhancements for the Object Model that make it more powerful.  Workflow in the product is good and intuitive.  Others have addressed that thoroughly and I don't have much to add there.  You get a large number of high quality fonts with X7, almost all from the Bitstream type foundry, which has been around for decades producing excellent fonts.  If you were to buy the fonts separately, the cost would easily surpass the entire price of this package.  Overall, I have found this to be a great upgrade.  The 64-bit core allows the program and computer to exploit full memory resources and gives a great boost to stability and speed in my experience.  This is a powerful tool for graphic design and isn't too daunting to learn to use.  Highly recommended.",946

The story has three reading levels which auto-adjust the sentences to match your child.  There are modes:  Read to Me (LeapFrog reads the story), Read with Me (LeapFrog pauses on each page for learning activities) and Read on My Own (self-explanatory).  Mr. Pencil is the character that guides your child through the learning experience.  There is writing - building basic letters in upper and lowercase, too.  My granddaughter enjoyed the story until she mastered it, then she got bored with it rather quickly.

468.0,28,5.0,"Microsoft finally got it right with Windows XP (Home Edition).  Based upon the highly reliable Windows NT, XP is a stable, reliable, and thoroughly functional operating system that cures most of the flaws that earlier versions of Windows are known for. First and foremost, the ""Blue Screen of Death"" is gone!  I run XP on three computers in my home via a home network, and I have literally never seen the dreaded Blue Screen.  While both Windows 98 (which I thought was a pretty good OS) and Windows ME (horrible!!!) require frequent re-booting, XP does not.  You can go weeks, even months, without rebooting XP.  It is stable and reliable. Speaking of home networks, XP Home Edition does a very good job if you want to set up a peer-to-peer network in your home.  We run one notebook (via a wireless connection base station hub) and two desktops via XP, and you can literally set something like this up in less than an hour, counting hardware hookups.  The Networking Wizard actually works, and takes almost all of the pain out of setting up a network.  If you want a peer-to-peer home network, XP is for you. One warning--XP does not support a domain (server) network.  If you are interested in this sort of configuration you want Windows Professional Edition.  You cannot use XP for this. Windows XP is well-supported as regards various peripheral devices.  When I upgraded, I had no difficulty downloading the necessary drivers for my three printers, one scanner, and various other devices.  Most worked OK out of the box, but upgraded drivers are available from most vendors via the internet. Speaking of the Internet, XP is truly dependent upon the Internet, and I would imagine that a user without Internet access would find XP very difficult to use.  XP is among the new generation of software of which Internet access is an integral design assumption.  The OS uses the Internet to register itself, obtain updates, and obtain drivers.  This is reflective of a trend whereby in my opinion every computer installation will in a very real way have as its centerpiece the Internet connection of the user.  Dial-up's days are numbered too--XP files, like most files nowadays, are simply too large for a 56K dial-up modem. In my opinion Microsoft hit a home run with Windows XP, almost enough to cause me to forgive them for Windows ME, which was absolutely awful.  If you are using ME, RUN, don't walk, to upgrade.",395

The software doesn't install on the computer.  With the cost of storage being so low these days, and with effective compression algorithims for audio (.mp3) and video (.mpg) that reduce file size, there's no reason to create a software product that runs from optical disc alone.  Even on a fast PC I built (AMD Phenom II 1100T 3.3 mhz hexacore processor with 8gb DDR3-1600 RAM, running Windows 7), the product takes a long time to switch between features, either because of the inherent slowness of optical disc access times or because you have to swap discs out to use different features.  Once upon a time, that was par for the course.  Now it's simply frustrating.  As others have commented, the interface leaves a lot to be desired.  These days it isn't hard to come across people with talent for graphical and website design, and there are dedicated software tools that make the process simple.  Unfortunately, none of those people or products appear to have been involved here.  This could be fun for younger users, but it doesn't have much staying power for the rest of us.

7354.0,489,5.0,"I have been making home videos for years. I used VideoStudio 7, 9, X1, X2 plus, X3 Plus, X4,X5 and now the latest X6. I also tried digital video softwares from Pinnacle, Roxio, Adobe Premiere. However, Corel software beats them for stability and easy of use. The Adobe Premiere is a great software, but it's overwhelming and overkill for most of us. In general, Corel's VideoStudio is less frustrating than any other softwares.  From product line point of view, Corel VideoStudio has all the basics, not a lot of bells and whistles that are hard to learn. The basic functions are easy to use and intuitive. You use the timeline to place video clips, then add transitions, background music, titles. After you are done, it can be easily exported to YouTube, FaceBook, Flicker...etc. Or you can burn your own DVD, or Blu-Ray disks.  By the way, editing HD videos requires a very powerful PC system, this is especially true if you are dealing with the highly compressed AVCHD videos. My system configuration is: Core i7 processor, 12 GB ram, Window 7 64-bit, 1GB video card, two SATA-2 drives. I have no problem to advance AVCHD videos frame by frame for precise editing, or to fast forward AVCHD videos for quick preview...etc. Also, the rendering time is fast. During rendering, my CPU usage can go up to 90%. If you see frame drop, out-of-sync between audio and video, color bleaching, software is slow to response to mouse clicking, video editing process is not smooth...etc, before blaming VideoStudio software, you may want to check your hardware system first.  Here is one trick I learned from professional Video Magazine. While running the VideoStudio with you main hard drive (like C-drive), you should put all video files (both the video input files and video output files) in a separate hard drive. Doing so can ensure a better system performance. With my system, if I put all the video files in the C-drive where the main program resides, from time to time, the VideoStudio program will still hang (not response to your mouse) for couple of second (not crash). This hanging problem goes away once I put videos files at a separate hard drive (not the C-drive).  So far, I have done couple home videos and created some AVCHD disks. I am very happy with the latest VideoStudio X6. Especially the newly added subtitling support.  Though I have long experience with VideoStudio, I would definitely recommend this software to beginners. It comes with so many pre-packaged automated processes that beginners can use them easily.",487

4553.0,299,5.0,I have been using Q since 1992 or before. Over the years the program has become very complicated and powerful. When it was simple - they complained that it was too simple. When it got complicated  - they complained the same. Now they like the simplicity of Mint - I assume the same will happen to Mint. Generally it is wise to grade every other year or when there is a OS upgrade. I read review from some who waited many years and had file conversion problems. I like the program and it serves me well! One can still use the simpler as aspects. This release seems solid and I upgraded because of Win 7. I can tell you that the Win 7-64 does have issues with the online backup.  Over the rear Q will release 5-7 upgrades to the program. They do try to fix things! The customer service is just typical of that most offer - that someone telling you to reinstall because they do not know anything else!  I Use Win7 64 ult. The online backup crashed. Contacted CS they asked me for the info. I was reluctant to spend any time typing the crash info. The CS rep personally asked 3 times and I did send it - one week later it was fixed and the official fix in the Q site. This is rare care - perfect C support. I am surprised! This person must been higher up the chain as he seemed to have access to the code. The rep had left his name. I could tell it was different from his second attempt. Thanks so much!,52

Here are the features that I have tried:  1 - Playing standard audio files. Most of my files are mp3's and I did not run in to any problem playing these files.  2 - Bluray - it plays bluray video discs very well. I have played 8 discs, all from Netflix, and have not had a problem with any of them crashing.  3 - On-the-fly 3d conversion: I tried this function with picture files, bluray discs and standard DVD's. The software, along with the 3D glasses this software ships with, combined to give something that really looks 3D in most cases. There were occasional abnormalities but nothing worse than what I saw watching Thor is 3D at the IMAX theater.  4 - Remote control from my iPhone: This took a while to get working properly. I just wish that there was a way to specify an IP address or Netbios name from the remote control, but I eventually got past that issues.  I have not tried the social media functionality and really have no intention to. I also get annoyed at the little advertising pop-ups but have learned to turn them out. I have not tried playing the full range of file types yet but will write more as I experiment.

The basic look and function of the program is so similar to Quickbooks, in fact, that one could easily mistake it for the current king of the hill.  To test this product, I set up books for a small business that I recently started and entered a number of basic transactions.  While some processes weren't as intuitive as I might have liked, it's relatively user friendly and it doesn't take long to get things done.  Like Quickbooks, the internal controls are awful and you can freely edit past transactions with no real audit trail.  This is convenient if you make a mistake, but a major no-no for those trying to run a genuine accounting department.  Office Accounting Professional is a competent program for those running a mom and pop business, but would not be sufficient for any more than that.  Unfortunately, I didn't see anything here that is a real improvement over Quickbooks and because of that, I don't recommend the product.  Because Quickbooks enjoys a near-monopoly in this market, there are several advantages to buying it.  Many bookkeepers and tax preparers will be able to take a copy of your data file and do their work, but none of them are likely to have this product.

3127.0,179,4.0,"I'm careful about what I let get onto my computer. I try not to visit suspicious websites; I never download attachments in emails unless I know who sent it and what it is.  That said, a lot of ""safe"" websites are full of adware, and even our best friends can pass along viruses without knowing it.  Years ago, our family lost two computers simultaneously to the same (particularly vicious) virus.  And yet I've never been too serious about virus protection.  If it came with the computer, and I could get a year for free -- great.  I'd try it.  Then I'd start to get irritated by the seemingly-constant ""update"" popups.  Virus software is serious about keeping you safe, to the point of almost being annoying.  After the year is over, I'm typically not in the mood to pay for continuing virus protection.  The result?  You'd like me to say I got a virus, right?  Nope, I've been without up-to-date virus protection for over a year, and I've been graced with nothing more than adware (which I remove manually using a free program I found online.)  Lately, however, both my desktop and laptop had been running slowly, and I got a bit paranoid.  What if they were both saddled with byte-eating viruses and I didn't even know it?  One thought leads to another, and suddenly I'm convinced I need Anti-Virus software.  So I get Norton, because the last one I had was McAfee and those little red popup messages drove me crazy (at least with Norton, I'd get a different color of popups, right?)  First, I installed Norton 360 on my 6-year-old laptop; the process was slow, and I'm thinking with the amount of hard drive space Norton takes up, it might not be worth it.  My 2-year-old desktop, on the other hand, handled the installation just fine.  The installation process was slower than I expected, but once Norton was up and running, I didn't have any problems.  It asked if I wanted it to scan my computer for badness, I said yes, and it found a handful of semi-malicious cookies.  According to the box, Norton 360 does everything that Norton Internet Security and Norton AntiVirus do... plus more, including a feature for restoring deleted or damaged files on your computer.  They also give you 2 GBs of ""secured online storage service,"" with the ""option to purchase more.""  2GB doesn't seem like much anymore, does it?  Still, it's something, and if you don't already have your own webspace, you may want to consider backing up certain files online, in case of a house fire or something.  All in all, if you're already careful about what you put on your computer, you take care of your own cookies, you already have free adware protection, and you regularly back up your files your own way, you may be able to do without this.  But it's nice to have this stuff all in one package, and -- dare I say it -- it's even kind of nice to get alerts when there IS something suspicious going on, assuming you really care.  If you need an extra selling point, the box claims you'll receive ""free, unlimited 24x7 email and chat support"" from Symantec, as well as phone support.  There's also a 60-day money-back guarantee.  I haven't actually needed that support yet, but that's a nice promise.  Edit: After several months of using this product, I have a somewhat minor complaint.  Even when I turn off the protection (a necessity when playing certain PC games with which anti-virus software can interfere) and I instruct the program not to turn itself on without my permission, it turns on anyway.  I'm also annoyed by the pop-ups encouraging me to engage in Norton's online back-up storage feature.  I have my own webspace, I do not need this feature.  I'll turn off the alerts, but a few days later, they're back.  I thought Norton would be less intrusive than McAfee, but that doesn't seem to be the case after all.",118

Either way you look at it, you are playing with the big wigs because you can now speak their language.

If you are dealing with people with limitations, you are the one with the ability to provide previous formats for them to utilize, not the other way around. With LT you can use anything.  And if the people you are providing any of this for have nothing remotely possible to use any of your creations, well, you simply export a PDF version, or even JPG and TIF images. In some cases, you can cater to Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.  So, obviously, people you are sharing your work with do not have to own this software.

4539.0,298,3.0,"As a user of Quickbooks 2007 and 2009 after it, I was looking forward to trying out the latest and greatest version to resolve some nagging issues that I had with the 2009 version (some of which were carry-overs from 2007 that I figured would be fixed in 2009) and gain much-needed compatibility with Windows 7.  Most importantly, I wanted to have complete compatibility with Windows 7 (64 bit). While QB2009 worked for the most part, it was not able to generate PDF files and it was a little fussy about applying updates without running in Administrator mode. Generating PDF's is how I generate invoices and send them out by E-Mail, so this is an important feature for me.  On that point, I was very happy when QB2010 installed on both Windows 7 RC and the release version successfully. Unfortunately, a subsequent update caused PDF generation to fail. This update (R5) was done by Intuit on December 29, 2009, and nearly 3 months later, it has not been fixed. Fortunately, there is documentation in Intuit's support site about a workaround that is successful.  For them to break functionality and then not fix it after more than two months is inappropriate, and it calls into question what they might break in future revision updates. I will definitely think twice when any new updates are flagged and check around before applying them.  Aside from that, how does Quickbooks 2010 work?  Sadly, some nagging interface issues have existed in Quickbooks since at least the 2007 version and the company shows no sign of improving them.  For example, the process of entering billable time is very clunky. The fields do not default to a preset value, or even the last value entered. For a sole proprietor, there is never a need to enter a different person for whom time record applies. Rather than default to the only employee name present in the Employees list, the drop-down insists on looking through all of the ""Other Names"" for possible matches. My name is listed above the ""other names"" but as I type, it ignores my name at the top of the list and shows the first match to the letters typed until enough of my name has been typed to exclude all other possibilities. A small issue, sure, but aggravating nonetheless.  As a long-time Quicken user, my first impression of Quickbooks 2007 was that it was years behind Quicken 2006 in interface design. Dialogs look like they were designed when Windows 3.1 was all the rage. Being a business tool, I don't need or want animated clip art or unnecessary visual elements, but isn't it possible to introduce user interface elements that would make the dialogs more visually effective and maybe even a little more appealing?  In addition to a visual design that looks very dated, there are interface elements that are not suitably-sized for their contents. An example of this is in the ""Make Deposits"" dialog. The ""Deposit to"" drop-down box is so small that the names of the accounts do not fit. This makes it difficult to distinguish between accounts that may have similar beginnings with account numbers at the end. This forces me to change how I do things instead of the software adapting to my needs. The dialog has plenty of horizontal space, so expanding that field would not be a problem. The program is littered with examples like this, and I will not belabor the point by providing more examples.  The time it takes Quickbooks to start and load a company file got longer from 2009 to 2010 as well. I'm not able to time-test between them, but the startup time is excruciating (~30-45 seconds), and it prevents me from being able to pop into the program, do a little data entry and get back out again and return to other tasks.  Should a Quickbooks 2009 user upgrade?  At this point, I would say no. Unless you need a feature that was introduced in 2010. Since I received 2010 at the same time that Windows 7 was officially released, I don't have any experience running QB 2009 under the released version of Windows 7. It's possible that the PDF generation issues in 2009 can be fixed with the same workaround that is necessary for R5 release of 2010.  I have found no compelling features in 2010 that were not in 2009. Everyone uses this program differently, so what may be inconsequential to me may be vitally important to someone else. However, based on my usage needs, so little has changed between Quickbooks 2007 and 2010 that Intuit should be embarrassed to continue charging $150+ for each incremental upgrade they release each year.  That said, however, Quickbooks 2010 does serve my needs. I am now entrenched in the program far enough that I would not be interested in moving to a different tool unless there was a significant reason to do so. The time and effort that would take would need to be compensated by a large benefit in usability, features, and/or productivity in my workflow.  While I will check out the inevitable release of Quickbooks 2011 in the hopes that some of these issues will be addressed, they will need to impress me with what I see before I would shell out another $150 for a new version.",789
6717.0,441,4.0,"I recently upgraded to this version of Quicken from Quicken 2010 Home & Business. I see very few changes that are not purely cosmetic. Although many users have complained about problems with Quicken 2013 Home & Business, I am not experiencing any obvious difficulties (except for one that I'll explain below). On the other hand, I am not doing anything particularly demanding. It's possible that I would be running into problems if I were using some of Quicken's advanced features.  The one difficulty I'm having stems from a change in my credit card number. I had previously linked Quicken with my credit card account. I received a new card with a new number. Quicken made me deactivate the account before it would take my new information, and when I reactivated the account and downloaded transactions, I wound up with a number of duplicate entries that I had to delete.  I've long used Quicken to track my finances. It has its quirks, flaws, and annoyances, but if there's something else out there that does the job better, I'm not aware of it.  Bottom line: If you already own a working version of Quicken Home & Business, you probably don't need to update.

It's called AVG and available from a company called Grisoft (grisoft.com).  It's completely free for personal use (i.e., don't run it on your SOHO or office PC or you'll be violating the end-user agreement).  It updates daily or almost daily.  I've been running the older version 6 and lately the new version 7 for a long time and it has never caused any problems.  It's very effective.  (Too bad the new version has a less friendly user interface than version 6, but seems to be slightly faster in scanning.)  No, I don't work for Grisoft or know anyone who works there.  I just appreciate their free program that works well.  They've been around for a while and many magazines have reviewed the free AVG (=""anti virus guard""?), so AVG is a safe program.  I just hope enough business users buy their premium version to keep the free edition going for many years to come.",70

6622.0,438,5.0,"When I saw Quicken WillMaker 2013 I didn't know everything that was involved with estate planning. That's where the plus comes in. With WillMaker I was able to create many documents that will help before I move on from this life. These include my living will, heath-care directive, and limited power of attorney.  I have to admit that it took a while for me to get around to creating a will and doing estate planning. I guess it just made that reality of life a little too real to me. When I did WillMaker plus made the process easier than I expected. It was effectively painless.  I didn't use the support - but other reviews provide glowing reviews which I suspect are founded based on the well thought-out software.  This is a good DIY tool for straightforward estate planning: probably 90+ percent of estates. It probably gets a good start on much more complicated planning that will requires a visit to legal office. The head start that WillMaker Plus could provide in paperwork and organization may save hundreds or thousands in legal fees compared to going in with nothing.",18

10902.0,697,4.0,"This is a product that one should both review and then later revise, because if there are problems, they will likely only arise in the long term. I installed this and ceased using Avast, which was possibly the worst antivirus problem I've ever used (it kept identifying valid files as viruses, so that whenever I used my computer I got nonstop Avast pop ups, with a voice telling me that Avast had located an infected file).  But the installation of McAfee went smooth as ice. I was able to click from one screen to the next and it seamlessly installed all the components. You go to the McAfee website, pop in the activation code, and click on the download link. You get an e-mail, click on the link, and apart from clicking a couple of more times, that's it. It may be the easiest installation that I've ever had.  There are additional features that come free with the subscription. You can schedule the various kinds of scans or activate manual ones. You can also adjust the level of security if the software is blocking too many valid sites or programs. Just to be clear, the program does protect your whole computer and not just your Internet browser.  This does not appear to be the memory hog that some security programs are. I have checked multiple times and have yet to see how much memory it uses, and I have yet to see it use more than 1%, even when activating deep scans.  So, so far so good.

The product integrates very well with Office 2007 ( the Full Enterprise Version , as well as lesser  types).With the full MS Office and Norton 360 to be installed,two reboots is common. Norton 360 covers PC Security, Identity Protection,Backup and PC Tuneup in broad terms. When errors in install occur, a reinstall utility covers and easily fixes problems. The setup shuts down Ghost until install is complete, and also until the backup setup is decided upon since 360 has its own backup technique. After initial setup, the configuration is pretty much automatic. All items are set up on what seems to be a standard basis, with the exception of the backup routine, which is something that can be turned on or off ( unlike the other three major sections) so that you can use the Norton GHOST backup should you want to do so. Its an impressive piece of software, great price, installs and operates extremely well. For a family machine with a non-technical or partially technical background, this is a great piece of software that operates well, and operates automatically.

11673.0,747,4.0,"I've tried both major tax software packages (this and H&R Block's) as well as the TurboTax Online version. While none of them is perfect, I think this is the best of the three. What sets this apart is that you have the option to do your taxes via a very simple interactive step-by-step ""interview"" or, if you know what you're doing, you can actually just jump from topic to topic. You even have the ability to just go to specific forms and fill them out directly. This flexibility means you can quickly fill out an area you're familiar with, but have the software lead you slowly through unfamiliar topics. I find that I generally go direct to things I've done several years in a row, but will do the step-by-step interview for areas that are new to me (e.g. when I first got married, or had kids, or got a small royalty check from a patent). If you get a form in the mail you don't recognize (1099-G, for example) you just do a search for it in the software and it tells you where to go.  My recommendation is that you save some money and start with this or Deluxe. If you actually come across anything that you really need a higher version for, or that would be nice to have, you can upgrade the software online and pay a bit extra, keeping all the work you've already done.

So when Apple offered to let me play with a review copy of Office for Mac I thought it would be fun to see how it compares to Office on Windows.  The Mac version provides good compatibility and pretty much the same functionality as the Windows version, and manages to do it in a Mac-style that won't have you always feeling like you're running a Windows app.  As a few seconds reading these reviews will tell you, Microsoft was unable to provide Visual Basic for Applications support in this version, so if you're on an older version and have dependencies on this then you probably don't want to upgrade, but for the rest of us who don't write applications  in Office, it's probably not an issue.  So what really is there to say about Office for the Mac?  Well, it's Office. For the Mac.  For a lot of people this probably tells you all you need to know if you're moving over to the Mac for the first time or working in an environment where Office is the de-facto standard for document interchange. If you're used to office on Windows, this will give you the closest experience in terms of functionality you're familiar with, and it does it in a very ""Mac"" way.  If you know you need it, or you know you hate it (or both) then you're probably not reading this review.

6913.0,456,4.0,"Hard to believe, that Microsoft has been trying to go for a new generation of P.C. owners with the release of a new operating system. A few years ago, they had tried that with Windows Vista and it was a well-dedicated upgrade from Windows XP. Then, they also had a second operating system at hands with Windows 7. That worked very well at each hand and each level. But for the younger crowd, they definitely wanted to show that there is more for a Mac generation, or a Ipod era as well. That is definitely the case with Windows 8. It is definitely Microsoft's latest attempt at trying to go after a younger crowd. The thought of the new operating system was awkward, but the younger look give a new direction to what Microsoft is trying to do to compete in a Apple Ipad era. But for those new to Microsoft 8, there can be more than meets the eye.  Windows 8, Microsoft's latest operating system is definitely a hard turn for them. At first, the operating system might be easy to operate, but you have a lot more in confusion for older computer owners. The differences really change on this system. I found this one at first to be difficult to setup. But after a few uses, I found it to be very easy to maintain. The system can be easy to log into when installing on a router, and easy to log into. the menu setup at first also takes a bit to get used to. But thankfully, there is a option that you can go to the basic desktop and laptop Windows features. I also found this laptop, to not be as compatible with my past Microsoft Word add-on. I was told by Microsoft directly that I would have to install a newer version of the Microsoft Office for it to be used. It also wasn't recognizing a printer that would be compatible for Windows 7 for this operating system. But my printers' company retooled that nicely. It definitely is a fairly well-designed setup that works nicely. I found it a bit easier to connect with this one than in the past with my music. It matches up very nicely for the Itunes and Windows Media Players' well, for a easier sync with my music.  Overall, my first impression about Windows 8 was mixed at first. But after a few days, I got mostly what I had wanted out of it. It definitely works well in laptops and desktops, not as much for anyone who is more of a tablet user. Still, it does the job nicely, and is a good buy for your money if you are still into Windows XP or Vista. Not as much for anyone who just got into Windows 7.

So for each upgrade you pay for, you get to spend a couple hours re-keying in all your special rules for your firewall so your P2P,  game software, tunneling etc. keeps working. - and of course, a year's worth of ""let that program talk to the Web"" responses are also lost.  2) You buy the product, but at the end of the yearly update subscription, you don't just lose the ability to update. The morons at Symantec have programmed it to TURN OFF YOUR FIREWALL COMPLETELY! Boom - you're left unprotected by the software you PAID for just because you haven't PAID AGAIN by a certain date for the new virus subscription. So if you happen to be traveling,  your computer could be left w/o even basic firewall protection until you get back and notice. This is TOTALLY un-acceptable!  So my recommendation is to spend your money elsewhere until Symantec wises  up. Unless these two issues are properly addressed, it really does not matter how good the other functions are. The product is not worth the effort to re-program the firewall each year and the risk of being left without even basic firewall protection just because the update subscription runs out makes it a non-starter.

10535.0,664,4.0,"In addition to reviewing entertainment products for Amazon (CD, DVDS, Books), in my normal daily life I'm a CPA and tax preparer. I've been using H&R Block  software for at least 20 years. It used to be called TaxCut (and I actually liked that name better.). There are two basic Tax Software companies - H&R Block and Turbo Tax by Intuit). I find that H&RB is somewhat cheaper and more user friendly. There are three levels of the software. In H&RB's case, it is Standard (Federal only), Deluxe (with and without state - but if you live in a stare with a state income tax you should buy the with state combo - much cheaper than adding a state later) and Premium (which really is for more detailed help for self-employed people). If you know how to fill in a Schedule C then you can use the Deluxe too. There are just more ""interview"" questions in Premium. I use the Deluxe.  Though I'm reviewing H&RB here, I'll point out helpful info for those who have used TurboTax in the past. If you have any need for Sched D - capital gains or capital gains dividends - you will need to buy the TT fancier version this year. The Basic version doesn't allow you to do a schedule D. This is another reason to use H&RB.  Now the reason I downgraded it from 5 stars is that you only get ONE State filing with either the Deluxe or Premium.  If you live in one state and work in another, you will need to buy (via download) an additional state module. This now costs $34.95 per state which is actually the same list price as the Federal& State package. And you can find the Fed & State on sale often. (Amazon had - as it did last year - a one day sale on January 2nd at 55% off. But there is no way to save on those additional states. Personally I think H&RB is getting greedy there. I think Turbo Tax does the same thing - but has a higher list price.  If your return is simple then by all means use the software. But you might want to also check out local CPAs, who have tax training, and see what their rates are.  It may not cost that much more than the time and effort you spend using either H&RB or TT, and they will be able to offer you support too and offer suggestions.

3520.0,224,4.0,"The ""Rosetta Stone"" language programs use an immersion technique to teach language, where all the lessons are done in the language you're looking to learn.  The idea is that it is how we all learn language in the first place, so it's the most logical way to learn a second language.  There are several styles of exercise in the Rosetta Stone program. The simplest version presents a word in the new language, along with several pictures, one of which matches.  Sometimes the word is spoken, sometimes written, and usually both.  More complex variations will present a number of phrases, which form a pattern, and ask the student to complete the pattern on a fourth phrase.  For example, one exercise might give the student ""The man is wearing pants,"" ""The man is wearing a hat,"" ""The woman is wearing a hat,"" and a picture of a woman wearing pants.  The student then has to give back the sentence, ""The woman is wearing pants.""  Again, there are different ways to do this.  Sometimes, it's a multiple-choice question, where the program will offer, ""The woman/man is wearing pants/a hat,"" and ask the user to select the appropriate words to fill in the blank.  Other times, the student must speak the entire sentence into a microphone.  (A USB headset/microphone is provided.)  This voice recognition is the most disappointing part of the program to me.  Simply put, it's not nearly as good as a person.  There have been many times where I've said an incorrect answer - knowing I'd messed it up as the words left my mouth - and had the program mark it as correct, and vice versa.  As the program always repeats the correct answer back, once it thinks you've given it, you shouldn't get led too far astray.  All in all, the Rosetta Stone software looks like an effective way to learn the rudiments of a language.  It excels at teaching and drilling vocabulary, and in offering many excellent examples of correct pronunciation.  It falls short of its goals in being able to validate the student's pronunciation, and in teaching subtle points of grammar.  For those, supplementing the program with conversation with a  native speaker, and a decent textbook will be invaluable.",679

It is not my intent to go over every feature the software package, since there are many outstanding reviews already posted. However, I would like to hit the highlights.  - When compared to Adobe Photoshop - as a pure graphics program it is tough to beat Adobe Photoshop. Most of us grew up using Photoshop and Adobe, so in many ways it is intuitive. The CorelDraw Premium Suite has many additional features which helps it to become a one-stop solution. In terms of price both programs are roughly at the same price point.  - What features do you need? As I stated above CorelDRAW is fully loaded suite of software - the question is - do you need it all? Will you need the video editing software or are you more comfortable with a rival program? Do you need to have the ability to create Flash media? If so.... by all means the CorelDRAW Premium Suite is probably perfect for you!  - The Video Editor - Perfect for YouTube and most video editing applications. While it may not rival Final Cut Pro it will serve the needs of a vast majority of your video needs.... now if you are planning to edit a full length feature film my opinion may be a bit dfferent.  - Installation - You can pick and choose the programs that you want to install.  Final Verdict - CorelDRAW Premium Suite is a very robust software package. The reason why I am giving it 5 stars is that it may not have the absolute best software for your application it does provide a VERY good option for everything and in terms of value that earns a 5 star recommendation from me.  5 Stars",536

If you decide to undo the update, Microsoft will break your task scheduler.  After undoing the upgrade, the task scheduler returned so many errors I couldn't write them down.  I found out that this is the case for many users and you need hours online to figure out how to fix it.  I thought windows 10 would be more secure, but after some research, it is not.

8719.0,558,5.0,"After spending countless hours trying to get Turbo Tax, which I'd used for about 10 years, to fill in and calculate my taxes correctly, I gave up and bought H&R Block At Home Deluxe + State 3 years ago instead. I've been happy with the software every year since then. The first year I did the online download through Amazon and it went quickly. Installation was straightforward as it is with the actual disc. In fact, the whole process went quickly and it filled in and calculated our taxes. It was able to handle the HSA account info I had for two of the year's accurately and without a glitch. This was what had caused the problem with Turbo. It also took me through itemized deductions, interest and dividends easily.  The interface isn't as graphically appealing as Turbo Tax, but it's easy to use and did my taxes accurately. I was able to download the state version for free and it took less than 5 minutes for it to install, get my info from the federal taxes and fill it out. Both state and federal seemed to go faster with H&R and it was very straightforward. I'll be using H&R Block from now on. H&R has a feature that can get your info from last year's Turbo Tax if you decide to switch over.",110

4983.0,333,4.0,"I was very concerned about buying this upgrade due to the flood of bad reviews I read, but they had me by the short hairs with the discontinuance of updating soon to take effect. I've been using Quicken ever since it came out, and Managing Your Money before that, and MS Money for a couple of years. I was satisfied with the 2008 version. There are some improvements in the latest version, most notably the faster updating and the ability for the update to bypass the frequent requests by some banks for answers to security questions. Additionally, I noticed a correction to estimated taxes. The Tax Schedule used to include the January 15th payment in the wrong year, but now you can identify the tax year involved and the report will be correct.  There are two complaints I have and that is the Tax Planner still will not allow you to choose the next year. It is locked on 2011. The other is the tax schedule lists interest by banks, but does not subtotal each bank. Your tax return requires interest be reported by each bank. If I discover anything more I will update this review.  Update:  I moved this review from the guide book to the product itself.  One change I do not like is the way the ""overview"" presents itself now.  Previously, the individual account holdings were shown and no other stock would appear, but now the complete list of stocks you have in your portfolio list shows and you must scroll through it to find the stocks that are currently in the particular account.  I have a long list of stocks, perhaps a hundred that I have bought and sold over the years.  Most are inactive, but they show anyway.  What a mess this is.  I liked the 2008 version of the ""overview"" far better.  I noticed a small problem.  When you reconcile an account you have the option to use a statement or the online balance.  Once you have chosen ""statement"" it seems to always return to statement even if you have subsequently elected to use the online balance method.  I have tested this many times by unchecking the statement choice and even going as far as removing the statement balance, then selecting the online balance method.  The very next time you reconcile it will choose ""statement"" for you.  It is an annoying inconvenience.  One other minor issue is the sound effects.  When you first open Quicken there is a very loud gong noise that will make you wish you had left the sound system off.  The remaining sound is like an old manual cash register ringing up a sale and is tolerable.  Due to the startling nature of the opening ""gong"" I went into preferences and turned the sound off.  My overall assessment is that this product is worth the price even at retail, but you can get a very good deal if you search for it.  I pretty much use Amazon because the prices are really good and you can trust them.  No, I don't work for them or own stock, but I wish I bought a boatload when it was at 32 cents a share!  Let me describe one huge advantage of getting frequent or daily updates.  You can check your credit cards for errors well ahead of the arrival of the statement.  If your card has been stolen you can track its use.  You can inform your issuer in detail about what is yours and what is not, and you can contact the stores where the illegal purchases have been made.  In other words you can stay on top of your credit card activity.  I have used Quicken this way for years and have discovered duplicate charges, and erroneous charges by businesses within hours of the charge being made.  Update: Do not import data from Quicken into tax software without realizing that there will be errors.  When interest for December is credited it normally gets posted in January therefore when you create a tax schedule it will include the previous year's December and not include the current December.  So, when you make the tax schedule you must do a custom search avoiding interest posted in the wrong year and capturing data for the current tax year posted in the following year.  I recommend waiting for the tax forms from your financial institutions before submitting your tax return.",808

4485.0,294,5.0,"I have used PaperPort on and off for 10 years.  The software allows users to convert scanned documents into editable digital documents through optical character recognition (OCR).  If you have a need to scan original paper documents into editable electronic file formats then you should consider buying PaperPort 12 Professional because the software is easy to use and very powerful.  I have divided this review into two parts; 1) basic explanation of technology and terminology, 2) product review.  1) Technology Most documents, when scanned, are put in TIF format (although there are various other formats as well).  OCR converts those scanned documents to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc., and then the documents can be edited.  OCR software analyzes each pixel in a scanned file (we'll use TIF as our example) and tries to figure out and recognize symbols and letters.  A TIF is made up of thousands of individual pixels just like the resolution on a digital camera (measured in Dots Per Inch (DPI)).  The OCR software compares what it is sensing in the TIF file to character tables and charts until it finds a match.  The OCR recognition process happens very quickly so an entire TIF page could be recognized in a few seconds.  PaperPort's OCR engine can process a multi-page TIF document (think of a 20-30 page scanned file) and open it in MS Word for editing or cataloging.  PaperPort controls the entire process of scanning a document to opening it in Word or another program.  2) Product Review Installation was easy.  The software found my all-in-one HP printer/scanner/copier and I was easily able to scan documents using the PaperPort scan interface.  Once I scanned a few documents, I played around with the OCR technology which was impressive.  I scanned a 3-page legal document into TIF format, then with PaperPort I used the drag-and-drop feature to convert the TIF into MS Word so I could make edits.  PaperPort quickly converted the TIF into MS Word.  Once in Word, I could edit the document as if I had just typed it.  PaperPort does a decent job at preserving formatting but it isn't perfect.  For example, you might need to clean up the alignment or occasional spacing, but overall I am pretty satisfied with formatting preservation.  Conclusion: If you need to scan paper documents into digital format for editing and storage, then consider PaperPort 12 Professional.  If you just need to scan documents for storage, then you do not need PaperPort's advanced capabilities, you can simply use the software that came with your scanner to capture images for digital storage.  P.S.  This review seems to keep defaulting to the PaperPort 12 product page, although my review is actually for the PaperPort 12 Professional version (Amazon glitch, I guess).",998

822.0,49,5.0,"I am a computer geek. I have a lot of devices, many of those with ethernet ports. For instance, I have a PRISMIQ Media Player that hooks to the TV to watch videos and photos stored on the computer.  That device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).  I wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didn't want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.  A bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the device's RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, it's talking to a wired ethernet, even while it's not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.  Setup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devices's IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and that's it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesn't have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).  Another bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, don't worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebook's ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and that's it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.  The downside: It's expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive ""ethernet to Wi-Fi"" converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.  The PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang ""g"") and also in 802.11a. Unlike the previous model (PCWADE50) this one claims to support 72mbps ""turbo"" mode in 802.11a!

4670.0,311,5.0,"I'm giving this Corel product 5 stars, because I think what it does, what it provides, is exceptional, compared to other software I've used.  But it caused major problems with some of my other software, so I have uninstalled it for the time being.  This WordPerfect Office X5 comes with thousands of clipart images, and almost 200 digital photos.  I can't remember if it asked during installation if I wanted those installed, or if you could just access them when you wanted by using the disk.  I just know they were installed, and they all appeared to have ended up in my Microsoft Digital Image Library, and my library of photos is basically destroyed.  Even after uninstalling the Office X5, all the images are still there.  I'm obviously going to have to uninstall the Digital Image software and reinstall.  Hopefully, that will clear up the matter, because there is no longer support offered for Digital Image, and I really like Digital Image software!  I'm pretty sure all my photos are in MY Pictures, so I won't lose them, but will have to burn them just in case.  Only, I can't burn them using the Digital Image software, because I can't even find them in all that clipart.  My second reason for uninstalling Office X5 may seem trivial to some, but it it not to me.  Before getting this software, I used Microsoft Works 8 software, namely Works Word.  Comparing the Works Word with the X5, I discovered I liked the X5 word processor much better.  It offered a lot more choices.  But it had an inferior dictionary, compared to Works Word.  The dictionary of my word processor is VERY important to me.  Corel has the Pocket Oxford English Dictionary.  I don't know what the Works Word has, but it has A LOT more words, and is a far superior dictionary.  Now, the X5 software asks if you would like to use the Works Word instead of the X5, so that would make the matter seem trivial.  I figured I could use either software, depending on what I was writing.  And then figured I could probably use the Works Word dictionary with the X5, since you can use it after closing Words Work; you just keep it minimized in the taskbar. Unfortunately, however, installing the X5 did something terrible to the Works Word--the Works Word dictionary disappeared!  It was no longer under tools--it was just gone!  I tried to do a repair with the Works Word disk, but there was no change.  Hence, I uninstalled the X5, uninstalled the Microsoft Works 8, and reinstalled the Microsoft Works 8.  The dictionary was back.  Now, I have not contacted Corel support about these matters yet, but intend to do so when I get the time.  Right now, I need to use a word processor with a good dictionary.  But I really want to reinstall the X5 and make it work with my other software.  As I said in the beginning of this review, it offers so much!  If there was a choice when installing about the clipart, then that problem would be easily resolved--just click ""no"".  Also, I'm guessing I could install a great dictionary that I could use at any time on my PC.  The X5 looks like such fun--I really don't want to pass it up.",962

I mean, it's nice to know the software is working, but my thinking is, just do your job well and shut up!  Trend seems to have WAY less annoying notifications.  It is also perfectly compatible with Windows 7.  I waited a couple of months to write my review, to see what would develop, and I'm glad I did.  One minor annoyance is that Trend, on a couple of occasions, deleted cookies from a couple of store's websites that I visited.  It was truly a MINOR problem -- it didn't, for example, delete my email website's cookies or anything that annoying.  And I figured, well, if it's vigilant against spyware, maybe that's a reasonable price to pay (because it HAS found spyware and successfully removed it).  The only major problem I had was about a week ago, when I suddenly was unable to use any of the 3 photo editing/importing programs I have installed on my computer, as well as a couple of other programs...my computer would freeze to the extent that I had to do 7 force-shutdowns in the same day.  I was truly puzzled, as I hadn't ""changed"" anything on the computer -- then Trend popped up a note that said a recent Trend update may have caused problems on my computer that could result in a system freeze.  They promised to fix the update shortly -- it took them about a day and a half, but they did send a new update that fixed the problem.  Since then it's been perfectly fine -- but that was WAY more than a minor inconvenience.  So...I'd like to say that I recommend Trend to a Windows 7 user, but that was a major problem.  They did fix it, but for some people, 24-48 hours is a LONG time to go without the full use of their computer!  I am hoping that is the last incident of that kind with Trend...time will tell.  ------------------------- UPDATE:  3/27/10 -- So, I uninstalled Trend and went back to using a previous anti-virus/spyware software (Vipre)that I already had, since I had a couple of months left on the yearly subscription.

I was sad I got plus because I didn't realize there was a higher ultimate version and there was no way to upgrade. So this time I'm glad to be getting ultimate.  Things that are new for 19: -Project Bins--a bin that you can throw a bunch of video/sound that you want to use, or a way to put video/sound into a organized bins without having to move the videos from the folders they really are located in. The bins contain video links, not the actual videos. This is great for me. I like having my videos organized by time and events. Also I have tons of videos and pictures in one folder. This allows me to grab the best and bin them without creating duplicate video folders and taking up more space. It helps me not to have to go through a folder with hundreds of pictures/videos over and over again. I love this feature! (And they needed to add it since Adobe Elements 13 added it) -Even more effects--like I didn't waste enough time already over effecting my home videos... Thankfully there's now a favorite section so you can put your favorite effects where you can easily get to them. -Multicam support--If you have a party or wedding or wherever you might have more than one people videoing, it's pretty cool to be able to jump around the cams. If you have audio for your videos, it even tries to line them up automatically! -Support for more file types and better 4k support.  When you open it up, it looks very similar to 17 or 18. It's an evolution and refinement with more features. It's good to know they didn't change everything! It's run pretty smoothly so far, but I have a pretty powerful computer. I don't have anything higher than 1080p to play with, but I've not had issues. I do suggest you use the system requirements as a very minimum requirement. I wouldn't try running this on anything less than an i5 with 8GB of ram and would prefer to have an actual video card in there too--and that may still give you a lot of waiting when crunching higher res video. I wish Pinnacle would give you a suggested computer setup for different levels of performance. I'm running it on an XEON 1650v3 with an NVIDIA Quadro K2200 and 16GB of ram. That's basically the equivalent of a high end i7 and a GTX 750. You're going to have a completely different experience running this on your $400 laptop than a performance machine. Video editing takes a lot more processing than picture editing.  But I was able to trim, split, combine single and multiple HD videos with no issues. I could have saved in many formats and DVD. It does bluray with an additional purchase. But, disk based media is practically dead. I'm just glad it lets me save it as a mp4. It will also export to Facebook, Youtube, and Vimeo.  My understanding is that Pinnacle provides little if any support. And I think that's the main disadvantage over Adobe Premier Elements. I can google all sorts of issues with Adobe Premier Elements and find all kind of help. It may be slow support with a strong accent, but I can call Adobe. Pinnacle Studio does have tutorial videos on their site and on Youtube. It looks like more videos for 19 are coming and most of the 18 videos do apply. There is a knowledge base in the support section and the ability to email support (free for 15 days from purchase...). If it works great, you're good. If it doesn't work for you or you have problems with the program--good luck...  But for me it's been working great. It hasn't crashed once. The way it works makes sense to me. If you're still deciding, go to youtube and search for ""Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate - Basic Editing Beginners Tutorial"". That will give you an idea of how the program works. I think Premier Elements is a little bit easier for a beginner, but I think it's easier to do some more complicated things with Pinnacle Studio.",1171

My MacBook Pro has the exact same RAM and processor but, as all Mac users know, code written on the Mac operates much more efficiently than Windows code. Screen changes, image refreshing, file rendering are noticeably, and impressively, faster. Panning or zooming on an object is no longer a reason to go get a cup of coffee while you wait for the screen to refresh.  I've drank a LOT of coffee with the Windows version.  PDF output is excellent, and fast.  The caveats:  **Unless you've used AutoCAD for a while on the PC already, you'll probably need to buy a third-party book if you need instruction on how to use it.  I was stunned to receive the lowly DVD case with one DVD, and no documentation.  Yes, I know, who includes printed docs anymore, but you would expect for the price that there would be some type of getting started doc that would be user-friendly to newbies.  A good book on using AutoCAD will cost you another couple of hundred bucks which, for some, may add insult to injury.  **Another insult is this version is subscription based, and comes with a one-year subscription. I don't know what the annual subscription will be after that, but I suppose somewhere in the middle of the night 12 months from now, my Mac version will quietly expire, and I'll need to reach for the Amex to bring it back to life.  **The Mac version can only be installed on two Macs, and those two Macs cannot run the program simultaneously. This means, you can run AutoCAD on your desktop MAC at the office, and on your MacBook Pro (you really don't want to run this on anything less than that) and you can share files between the two.  But, you can't be using it at home on the laptop while a colleague is using it at the office.  **Expensive.  Yes, it's a high price tag, but there's really no valid equivalent to this software on the market.  It's not a consumer product, and not even a pro-sumer product, so it's priced for the professional who is doing mid-to-high level design for architecture and product prototyping.  All that said, it's an elegant transformation of an industry warhorse, and will surely not disappoint the most demanding user.",1381
2392.0,187,1.0,I wouldn't normally suggest this but do not upgrade!  Vista takes the only good thing about Microsoft products - which is the advantage of an interface that you already know - and breaks it.  Vista really is different than any of the previous versions of windows but in the worst of ways.  Here's a typical example.  Want to do something simple like search for a file?  Too bad!  They have a much faster version of search with just one problem - no place to enter the search criteria.  Overall I think that the only people who have gained from Vista are Apple and Linux users since there should be more defections with the Vista fiasco.,896

462.0,26,5.0,"I may be going out on a limb here, but Windows XP is the most important upgrade to the Windows operating system since Windows 95. In addition to a new look, it offers stability, ease of use and more Internet integration than ever before. Installation was easy. You can either upgrade your existing Windows or do a clean install. I recommend a clean install so be sure to back up your important data (e-mail, accounting programs, etc.) You can boot from the CD and it will pretty much to the rest. Installation takes about 30-60 minutes but it was VERY easy. XP really knows what plug and play means. ALL, and I mean ALL of my peripherals were found and configured automatically. Once installed, you will be prompted to activate. This was an easy and fast process. The next thing it will do is set up your Internet access. Once this is done, you are now ready to go. You will notice right away that the interface is different and very colorful. It may take a little while to get used to but once you do, you will like it. You also have an option of a ""classic"" Windows 9x view. Windows XP makes a lot of functions very easy. First of all, depending on your BIOS and motherboard, you can tell Windows just what to do when you press your power button. It also has built in CD burning capability, however, to delete a file from a CD-RW, you must erase the CD and then put back the files you want. A little inconvenient but a lot more stable than DirectCD. It is VERY easy to set up individual users. You can set up a personalized account for each member of the family. Also, when installing many programs, it will detect XP and ask if you want certain people to access the program. This is very nice and secure. And with Internet Explorer 6.0, you can now choose the level of cookie protection. You will be amazed on how many third party ""usage tracking"" cookies that are placed on your PC. Backward compatibly is very good to excellent with XP. XP ran all of my older windows based programs and MOST of my DOS games. A newer Windows game didn't work correctly but all it took was to make it run in Windows98/ME compatibility mode and it fixed it. A few DOS games worked about 80% and some not at all. I am sure that ""DOS EMULATORS"" will be available for purchase in the near future. Windows XP seemed designed for Internet integration. Just about every major function in XP has a tie to the Internet. And because of this, Microsoft has included a built in Firewall. It is good, but I would recommend Norton Internet Security 2002. For those of you who are worried about compatibility, Windows XP makes it pretty easy to set up a dual boot. All you need is a partition created before installing. After that, Windows does the rest. For those who want security, go with Windows XP Professional. Everyone else can get by with Windows XP Home. If you have a previous copy of Windows, get the UPGRADE version. It will search for a previous install or ask you for the original Windows 9.x/2000 disk to verify. There is a lot more I can say about Windows XP but you just need to see it for yourself. If you want stability, awesome Internet integration and overall easy of use, you must get this upgrade.",379
7560.0,500,4.0,"There are quite a few things that I like about this product. First off, the software is downloaded directly online. Shipped is a cardboard envelope with a credit card sized card with an activation number to create an account. If you want to download the software on additional devices, simply connect to the internet with the device, go to your account page and install the software. No more having to store discs! The software itself is decent. I have only used it on my laptop, but I love it. There are occasional pop-ups, but you can choose not to see the messages again. I have used norton before, and one thing that drove me insane was the constant pop-up windows. You could disable them for up to a day, but then they would turn back on. If you want a hassle free software, both when installing and using that is not expensive, I highly recommend purchasing this product.",1423
8830.0,567,4.0,"Unlike quite a few other users, I found Pinnacle Studio 17 Plus fairly easy to learn and use. And I had no issues with installation either. I think the problems people are having must either be user, hardware requirements, or computer settings related. And I do own a previous version of this software, so that could be why I didn't experience any problems or confusion with setup and use. My last version of this software was version 14, and I did find version to be quite a bit faster and better.  Now, while this version has a lot of editing tools, for only a few dollars more you can get Pinnacle Studio 17 Ultimate. And in my opinion, given it's only a few dollars more, that's certainly the way to go. Pinnacle Studio 17 Ultimate will allow you to produce next generation 4K videos and Blu-ray videos. And while that may not be important to you right now, it likely will be in the not too distant future. And the Ultimate version also gives you more 2D and 3D special effects, the Red Giant Filmmaker's Toolkit, and the Motion Graphics Toolkit. It's well worth the few extra bucks.  Now, while all the improvements to version 17 are really terrific, what makes this new version a winner is the fact that it's still very affordable. Pinnacle Studio 17 Plus is a great set of tools at a great price. A bargain really. You get a lot of bang for your video editing buck. It contains all the tools you need to make really great videos. I recommend this latest version highly.",1744

6439.0,431,5.0,"I've wanted Corel Draw Graphics Suite for several years but my budget always got in the way! I purchased Corel Draw Essentials, older versions of Corel Draw, and a home and student version. None of these satisfied me! What has satisfied me is Corel Draw Graphics Suite X6. It has all the features I want. easy to navigate, and has a 300+ hard cover guidebook! Since I am familiar with earlier versions of CorelDraw, I haven't had occasion to use the manual (yet)... but what I did discover about the manual is that offers a lot of ideas for the tools that are part of CorelDraw and I probably would overlook the possibilities. This is a first-class graphics suite in every way and inclues not only CorelDraw X6 but also Photo-Paint, Power-Trace, Website Creator, Corel Capture, and more. I like Photo-Paint, a professional photo editing application. If someone asked me if this is worth $500, I'd certainly say, ""Yes!"". Believe me, you'll get your money's worth with this edtion of CorelDraw. Additionally, there are 1,000 professional Open Type fonts, thousands of photos, images, and templates. There's also a two-hour training video to supplement the manual! CorelDraw Graphics Suite X6 functions as smooth as silk! Highly recommended.",1268

There are versions with GPS and others without.  Mappoint is more though, Mappoint is designed with the business user in mind.  You can integrate Mappoint with Microsoft Office and Access databases and use it to create beautiful business map graphics that are based on geography and then import them into powerpoint.  If you're a business user developing marketing plans, analyzing markets, deciding where to put your next franchise, Mappoint is a great tool to help you with that.  I have to admit that I've been a Mappoint user since the product first came out and back then it cost upwards of $1,000 but that price has been dropping.  I think this is predominantly based on competition from online cloud tools like googlemaps and mapquest.  The biggest change is that some of the buttons have been changed to give it a more user friendly look and feel to it (the layout is less cryptic than before) and it has more options for data visualization.  However, when it comes to doing business analysis, Mappoint is still a superior product because you're working with the data locally: local maps, local software, and local databases which allows you to model and run through versions much faster.  You also don't have to deal with the internet and whether the online application will be available or not.  At its current price point, I highly recommend this product for the small business or small franchise that is analysing data or for marketing professionals.  You will be rewarded with much faster performance.  INSTALLATION: took about 7 minutes and installed fully to my machine so I don't need to keep a DVD in my machine - which is great.  COMPARISON TO GOOGLE MAPS This does everything that google maps does but offers more customization and because it's all on your computer, it's faster and you don't have to have an internet connection.  MAPS: The maps give you: - regular street view - terrain view - night view - political view - and you can customize with whatever data you want to integrate with - there is no satellite view that I could find (I'm still digging though)  STREETS AND TRIPS OR THIS This has all the functionality of streets and trips but adds the data integration component.  If you're a business professional on the road a lot then this product can be your streets and trips (you can integrate a GPS into it) + you get the ability to integrate data into it to create your presentations without having to connect to the web.

6959.0,462,3.0,"When I first noticed Cyberlink PhotoDirector 4, I was hopeful that Cyberlink had produced the first must have photo editor since the advent of JASC Paintshop Pro 8.  In some ways Cyberlink Photodirector is a great program and in some ways it is a frustrating program to use.  Why frustrating?  PhotoDirector is very good for making adjustments to photos (white balance, tone, HDR, Clarity, Vibrance etc..)  Where PhotoDirector is weak is in the editing department.  PhotoDirector is missing a true clone tool.  This is a major oversight.  Cyberlink essentially copied Adobe Lightroom tools.  However, If Cyberlink wants to win business they have to be clearly superior to the current leader.  Currently, PhotoDirector is not.  A true clone tool with selectable brush styles, angles and sizes would be a good start.  The need to import photos is a pain, I already have my folder structure established.  I don't know why the latest photo programs insist that they also manage your photos.  None of them come close to the free Google Picasa for this task.  Finally, Photodirector prompts you to save every time you switch from the Editing Tab to the Adjustment Tab.  Why?  Instead remind me to save when I am finished editing and and ready to move to another photo.  Conclusion:  Cyberlink is a good company with a history of improving their products.  I am hopeful they will fix these issues and produce and must have product.  What is a must have product?  A photo editor that combines a mixture between the adjustment features of PhotoDirector 4 or Adobe Lightroom with the photo editing abilities of PaintShop Pro or Adobe Photoshop elements. Clients have been clamoring for a program like this for years.  Come on Cyberlink, make it happen!",518

When they ask me how I did a specific techniques, the tools are just not available in Photoshop to do the same thing. What takes a few steps and layers in Painter, takes a lot more work and steps in Photoshop.  It does take a bit of time to become really comfortable with the program. But once you are comfortable, the variations possible make it a great product for digital artists. The brush tips, the patterns and shape tools make it easy to create an image from scratch.

10860.0,693,1.0,"UPSHOT: YOU TURN YOUR COMPUTER/DEVICE INTO BIG BROTHER BY AGREEMENT IN THE LICENSE AT INSTALLATION, IF YOU INSTALL WINDOWS 10.  Never before in history has such a 'license' created such awful terms.  Look in the comments for links so you can see the language for yourself.  I can't put the links in an Amazon review.  SERIOUSLY YOU NEED TO SEE FOR YOURSELF PRIOR TO INSTALLATION, WHAT HITLERIAN TERMS YOU'RE AGREEING TO.  Installation is also extremely glitchy.  About 50% of the installers' reports I've read, are 'smooth', especially from Windows 8.1.. else, glitchy.  Given the above warning, I spend a lot of time watching how people in tenforums, wilderssecurity forums, bleepingcomputer and even microsoft community, are suffering with installing this horrible new Windows 10.  I do have it, but as an Insider.  I write extensively about it in bleeping computer and vimeo PC World Alumni forum and brainout(dot)net frankforum (latter two are my own), so you can read more there.  It has no confidential data on it, and the hard drive is removable.  I personally own 16 Windows machines which are eligible for this thing 'free'.  So obviously if I found it good, would get it for them all, and say so here.  But Windows 10, is scary.  First time, Windows is scary.  You'll have to see it yourself to believe it:  at least, I did.  That's why I became an Insider, first.  So here, I feel I owe it to my fellow Amazonians to disclose the upshot of this awful installer:  1.  It will only allow you to do a so-called 'inplace upgrade' ON TOP OF your current Window 7 or 8, which 50% of the time results in disaster.  People do it, to keep their current programs and settings.  Don't bet on this working.  Even experts are getting it wrong, see the 1st paragraph's forums.  That is also how the free version works.  Just avoid this option like the plague it is.  2.  The other option is 'clean install', which here is only available if purchased.  But people who use this, are having really bad luck, and Windows help personnel always blame the seller, so make you go back to the seller.  So here, unless the seller sells you support with the license (and they usually do not), then you shouldn't buy.  The problem with 'clean install' is the installer looks for a key.  The key you are supposed to provide, is a Windows 10 key.  The key you get is a Windows 10 key, but the installer often won't recognize it. When you call MSFT for help, often you're told they can't help, you must go back to the seller.  So if they are not the seller, you're s.o.l.  More importantly, the license is downright frightening.  It's so much worse than turning your machine into Big Brother, but Microsoft tells you that you agree to let IT play Big Brother on you, even if you turn off all the privacy destroyers baked into the thing.  This is a series of lawsuits waiting to happen.  And what do you get for all this?  Nothing you didn't already have.  Frou-frou that doesn't work:  Windows 'Hello' requires a special camera you don't have, Windows Xbox requires Xbox too, Hololens can't work yet, Cortana is a joke, Edge is a gray sheet of paper which gets papered with ads you can't get rid of, your search bar is turned into advertising if you search on the web, you can't get rid of Bing, you can't customize, there is no real Start Menu but instead a vertical version of the Win8 start Screen... and on and on with the nonsense.  Oh, and no you really can't revert within 30 days, they overwrite your windows.old folder with the first Windows 10 cumulative update.  Which happens, the day or the day after, you activate.  IF IF IF you managed to activate.  Do you really want to go down the rabbithole with Alice and be much poorer afterwards?  I thought not.  It gets two stars for two things it does well:  it runs old software and hardware which businesses use (not consumer stuff, business stuff).. really well. I use 1980's and 1990's business hardware and software, and Win10 can work with them.  Consumer stuff, maybe yes maybe no.  The MSfanboy proselytizing is at an all-time high.  Which should warn you immediately.  If faith is warranted in God or some product, then it shouldn't need salesmen.  So if everyone's trying to 'convert' you to it, something's VERY wrong with that idea of God or that product.  Right?  DISCLOSURE is one thing.  That, you need.  Selling is quite another, and the fanboys never tell you the many dark undersides to Win10.  So...  PLEASE DO YOUR HOMEWORK BEFORE BUYING THIS.  Links will be in comments after this review is approved, so you can read the license fright for yourself.",1118

It's great for professionals, amateurs, and just about anyone with an itch to draw.  Some of the enhancements for this edition include layer enhancements, additional custom brush tools, new image editing capabilities, and a new tool bar.  Past versions of the software have always been fairly smooth and used system resources efficiently and 2011 is just as smooth.  Coming from a past user perspective, it was very simple to get used to the newest version.  But even first time users will take command of the software very quickly.  Just about any age and any experience will catch on quick.  Installation was also quick and painless.  While I have used past versions, this was a new install on a Windows 7 machine with 4 GB of memory.  Like I said, installation was painless and performance of the software was top notch.  Use of a tablet or a Tablet PC obviously makes the software much more beneficial, but not required.  The toolbars are very intuitive and the user interface feels like an artist put it together, which is one of the reasons it is so easy to learn and use.  Most of the program's features just feel natural.  In no time at all, your brush strokes feel very natural.

With all the bugs and problems Vista had, I thought this had to be better right?  Hah!  no such luck!  First, the good.  I gave two stars for two reasons.  First, the UI is prettier and more polished looking.  I like the cycling wallpapers.  Second, DirecTV2PC actually runs more smoothly under Win 7 than it did under Vista, but like most programs, it takes much longer to load and be ready to use.  ALso, Media Center is updated to look slicker and offer some more information, but it is slightly more sluggish than the Vista version.  In all, if I wanted a Mac (for a pretty interface, but not much productivity), then I'd get a Mac.  Now, the bad (or at least as much as I can fit).  I used the upgrade rather than a clean install because I only had my computer for less than a month and I didn't have much running on it yet.  I used to boot up in 41 seconds with Vista.  Windows 7 is over 90 seconds.  Still not too bad, but over twice as long.  Most programs take longer to load in Win 7 than they did in Vista.  (I have a Duo Core 2.4 Ghz machine with 4mb ram, so that's not the issue.)  Then there are the programs that stopped working and the settings lost.  It took the better part of a day of frustration to get it to actually start serving music to my DVR's like it had been doing in Vista (weren't settings supposed to be retained?).  Then, I discovered that I can no longer print.  I had no problems printing with Vista, but my network access to the printer is now gone (it just cycles trying to connect until it gives up).  There are other problems too, but I think you get the point.  Then, there is the excitement over the touchscreen enhancements to Windows 7.  Only, I find out, the enhancement is a virtual keyboard.  The same virtual keyboard that HP was kind enough to include on the original Vista install for my Touchsmart!  Seriously, that's it?  What a bust!  I am really wishing I had stayed with Vista (and I NEVER thought I say that!).  The upgrade was free, but it still isn't worth the cost.

12083.0,772,4.0,"This is a tough product to review. On one hand, WordPerfect Office offers a powerful and very capable alternative to Microsoft Office. As multiple reviewers have already noted, if you really care about a document's layout the ""Alt + F3"" ""Reveal Codes"" feature is pretty much worth the cost of the purchase.  But the X8 version is not really all that different from the last version I used (X4). And what new features have been added pretty much apply to the Standard or Professional version of WPOX8 and not this one (Home & Student). At this point, I have to add that the ""Home and Student"" edition reviewed here is NOT the same as WPOX8 Academic (more on that in a bit).  So what does one get for $99 (Amazon price at the time of this review)? You get the essentials and they are: the WordPerfect document processor (equivalent to MS Word), Quattro Pro spreadsheet (equivalent to MS Excel), Presentations (equivalent to MS PowerPoint), Lightning (equivalent to MS OneNote), and the AfterShot 2 photo processing app. That's it, but that's probably enough for most folks. (Interestingly, Corel offers a stripped down version of this product -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-Office-5-3-Installs/dp/B006N1Q0W2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel Office 5 - 3 Installs</a>&nbsp;(essentially, the Corel version of MS Works) - and I can't help but wonder if, at $30, Corel is hurting WPO sales by offering Office (though I suspect Corel hopes Office will be a stepping stone to WPO)).  For me, the sweet spot (as it pertains to features is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-WordPerfect-Office-X8-Standard/dp/B01EB06R10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel WordPerfect Office X8 Standard</a>. But for some reason Corel puts it out of reach by pricing it at $250. I guess there must be some logic, but I'm not following. If you can qualify for the Academic Edition that's the way to go. For $80 you get WPOX8 Professional (which adds the Paradox database application) for less than this Home & Student Edition. Disappointingly, the Perfect Authority ""table of authorities"" feature is an add-on (at $199) for the Standard and Professional versions; perhaps even more disappointingly, Perfect Authority won't work with this (Home & Student) edition.  If Corel really wants to keep a foothold with the ""next gen"" of users it HAS to update the interface; the software still looks like it did a decade (or more) ago. Frankly, this looked good when WFWG 3.11 was the current OS (and that was 1993)! What with folks moving away from WPO years ago and now folks moving away from the desktop/laptop entirely, Corel has got to do something to refresh the look. Even the free, Open Source LibreOffice has updated its look. It amazes me is that it's the cheaper, less capable product - Corel Office - that uses a MS Word ribbon interface that is far more modern and user-friendly (to the eyes) than WPOX8. So if Corel believes WPO can survive because lawyers still like the pleading and authorities features, okay. But I think it is ultimately a losing strategy.  WordPerfect, despite its looks, is - I believe - a superior product to MS Word (if it matters to you what your document looks like behind the scenes). I have used both since the late 1980s and know that you can do more with the former than latter. Quattro Pro is equally as capable as Excel at most basic tasks, but the world is Excel-based (so most work in QP will have to be ""translated"" for use in Excel). Finally, I think Presentations is a better presenting app than PowerPoint, but once again, the world is PowerPoint-centric. Of the three, the least difficult to transition output over to an MS Office-centric world is WordPerfect (which is fortunate as WP is the reason I think most people buy this suite). Even if this is the case, don't discount the other two: I learned spreadsheets on QP and found it a bit easier to understand the concept of spreadsheets on QP than I did on Excel; same with Presentations (easier to use initially; which is kind of a hoot considering WP's long-standing reputation of having a steep learning curve!).  After Shot 2 is a full version photo editing/adjusting application. I don't do a whole lot of work with photos so my impressions are those of an amateur. But from all appearances it appears to be a comprehensive, full-featured app. It is, however, 1 version behind; the most current version is 3.x (which you will learn about when closing version 2 and being shown an offer to upgrade to version 3 for $49.  One last thought. Usually ""user help"" is an after-thought; the mind set these days seems to be that if you can't figure it out, do an internet search or buy an after-market book. It's pleasing to see Corel not going that route; the Corel Reference Center utility is superb.  Summary: 4 stars. Functional, powerful, capable, at $99 you get a great program at a reasonable price and one that doesn't require an email account to activate and keep active. A 5-star bit of software. But it looks so, so, so old; WPO is in drastic need of a facelift. And the features added to make WPOX8 better than previous offerings is slim. The old look and minimal reasons to upgrade earn -1 star. So while I really want to support Corel's latest edition of WPO, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that I think the optimal way to go (if you can't get the Academic version) is either to buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WordPerfect-Office-X7-Standard/dp/B00JC5Y6WM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WordPerfect Office X7 Standard</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-Wordperfect-Office-X7-Home-Student-Product-Key-Card/dp/B00YYCI98K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel Wordperfect Office X7 Home & Student - Product Key Card</a>. At $140 you get a more powerful suite in WPOX7 Standard than WPOX8 H&S and don't really miss anything for $40 more than WPOX8 H&S. If one decides to go the H&S route, WPOX7 Home & Student comes in at $40 and is essentially identical to WPOX8 H&S (but less than half the cost). Like I said, not sure I'm following Corel's pricing strategies; to me, Corel has to do something if it wants WPO to remain a viable product. Anyway, take a look at the attached comparisons downloaded from Corel's WP web page...(couldn't post .pdf files so screenshots will have to suffice; I also posted a screenshot of this review in progress so you can get a glimpse of the interface).",1638

12229.0,24,5.0,"Dell OEM Windows XP Professional RTM through SP1a is almost exactly like retail except for one small and one big difference. Windows XP of this type can install on multiple Dell PCs with minimal effort (provided you have stuff like drivers, and need a base service pack and not full updating. Full updating spoils the trick, because Microsoft grew wise to it. To explain this miracle to you, I have 4 Dell business PCs, a Dell OptiPlex GX400 from August 2001, running the RTM version (which does include the Microsoft Runtime for Java-Wikipedia is wrong on that) and it is only one of four PCs to run XP in this fashion. Windows XP Professional is installed using the same CD but updated to SP1a (but with the RTM having the Microsoft Runtime for Java, it's virtually SP1 original) on a Dell OptiPlex GX270, one of the ones that is supposed to have bad capacitors, but hasn't failed me yet, but then the fun continues. The GX270 has some updates for Firefox 3.6 to run on it, and it was no problem installing those updates.  Windows XP Professional is installed via the same CD onto a Dell Latitude D505 I bought to be my vintage laptop after the Clamshell iBook G3's hard disk died, and it is upgraded to SP2 flawlessly.  Windows XP Professional is lastly installed from this same CD onto a Dell OptiPlex 745 with a Pentium D CPU at 3.4GHz, and it is updated to base SP3 plus .NET Framework 2.0 on the 745, and they all installed and self-activated and as long as I don't do Windows Update on them, they all don't require their Windows XP CD-keys affixed to their cases (the GX400 had a $150 Microsoft OEM System Builder Windows XP Professional CD-key stuck on him as insurance should full updating be required in the future.  I am a computer nut, and I like tracing the history of a given OS back through the ages. Therefore, with my Dell OEM Windows XP Professional RTM CD, I can sit there and use the computer brand, models, and types out of that brand with those models I already desired to use.  Believe it or not, I am typing this review using one of the machines thus configured, specifically the GX270 Dell OptiPlex running Windows XP Professional Version 2002 Service Pack 1a.  Oh, and the browser I am using is Internet Explorer 6 SP1, so you know it's vintage.  This discovery is simply the most revolutionary thing to happen since XP was released. Oh, and by the way, here's the time for the little tidbit:  Dell OEM CDs of Windows XP Professional SP2 and later don't do this. They require a CD-key like any other version of XP. And if you get one of the XP Professional discs compatible with this money and effort saving trick, you can rest assured that like a Microsoft version of XP with only one minor exception-a Dell Solution Center button in the lower right corner of the Start menu above the Shut Down or Turn Off Computer button, again except for the fact that in order to get self-activation, you must be using Dell OEM hardware with a Dell BIOS (when the computer shows the progress bar, if it has a big Dell logo on it, you are good to go).  Again, with this CD trick, Microsoft can't fuss about what hardware you have changed or not, as long as the BIOS remains Dell branded-or if you update Windows, to where Windows is automatically updated.  This gives you leeway to run that cantakerous old peripheral (say a HP LaserJet 6P or a vintage weather monitoring system) that Windows Vista/7/8 just doesn't support.  Same way with software. If you want to run a vintage copy of Adobe Acrobat-say 7.0 or below, or a vintage copy of Adobe Photoshop (say 7.0 or below), you can, and buy a Vista/7/8 computer or a Mac for what they are good for, which is being modern Internet terminals.  So while this may not be retail, given the appropriate precautions, it's infinitely better than retail, unlimited installs given Dell hardware with Dell BIOS, and unlimited hardware changes (again, given Dell BIOS) and no bloatware. You are off and running with nothing more than the CD and burnt discs of the appropriate service pack or packs.",435
5112.0,343,1.0,"TurboTax Business 2010 has still not fixed bugs that have existed for several years.  In fact, I cannot tell that there is a single improvement over prior editions.  I think Intuit is milking this product for profit rather than investing in it.  For example, for corporations, the Form 1120 defaults to assuming that someone owns 20% or more of the firm, forcing the listing of such people on a form G.  As in years past, you must switch to forms mode, uncheck the box (never offered in the interview) that says someone owns more than 20% of the firm, and then manually delete the G.  The most infuriating thing about the 1120 is that as of yesterday, March 13, you could neither print nor e-file the return - which is due on March 15 (!) - because the TurboTax forms were out of date.  Yet, the iRS released the final 1120 forms on March 1.  How could it possibly take a vastly capitalized corporation like Intuit more than a day to make whatever minor adjustments were in the final forms?  TurboTax did update itself today, March 14, to allow for filing.  Infuriatingly last-minute nonsense.  When e-filing the 1120 today, now that the forms are available, I chose ACH debit (as opposed to EFTPS) to pay the tax due.  On the confirmation screen, TurboTax confirmed that I selected EFTPS (not) with an edit button to change it - clicking the Edit button took me back to the screen showing ACH and the bank routing/account numbers/etc.  Just one of a dozen or more glitchy buggy things.  A cosmetic bug, but one that is disconcerting, is a screen under Federal Review that just says ""This is Heading Text / This is a Subheading""  (screenshot posted with product images above).  Clicking the Federal Review tab again gets the correct page, but, really.  For trusts filing 1041, expenses allocated to income are still not allocated, by default, to interest and dividends (etc) by pro-ration, as is done by most tax preparers, not is there a question or checkbox in the interview to allow for that.  As in years past, all expenses are subtracted against interest, fully, first, then dividends/other income.  You have to switch to forms mode and find the checkbox to manually check to do the allocation as desired.  K-1 allocations are also not complete, with Foreign Tax credit not properly allocated to the beneficiary.  These are just a few of the issues in this clunky, never-improved, Intuit cash-cow.  For folks who are not tax nerds, you should have any return that is prepared by this software reviewed by a tax professional.

6891.0,454,4.0,"PROS: Best voice recognition/dictation software available for the Mac Very similar to the PC product Quick learning curve Easy set up Set up and ready to dictate in under an hour Works well with Microsoft Word  CONS: Resource hog Doesn't always behave like a Mac program Crashes/hangs (far less frequent with recent software update and upgrade in my RAM, but still occurs) Doesn't work as well with Pages or OpenOffice Doesn't play well with less conventional word processors Somewhat flimsy technical support, but does have a  robust website-based support for the first 90 days  MY SET UP:  before I get too deep into the review, I need to tell you what equipment I am using.  My iMac is a 21.5, mid 2011, 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5 (quad core), 12 GB 1333 MHz DDR3, AMD Radeon HD 6750M 512 MB graphics card, running OS X 10.8.2.  (This is not the latest and greatest iMac out there, but is more than powerful enough to exceed Nuance's specs for this product.  Moreover, this machine is far more powered than my comparison machine, my work PC which is an HP Compaq 8000 Elite, with a paltry 3 GHz, Core 2 Duo processor and only 4 GB of memory, running Windows XP and Dragon Naturally Speaking 11.5.)  THE QUICK OVERVIEW: When it comes to voice dictation software, the Dragon has taken over.  There might have been some early rivals a while back that were jockeying for position and there are definitely rivals out there for the commercial market... and, who knows, giants like Apple and Google have pretty amazing voice recognition software in their own right; but, at this point in time, the only realistic choice in dictation software for the home consumer these days is Nuance's Dragon Naturally Speaking. That said, Dragon Dictate is their Mac version.  On the whole, this is capable software, on par with Nuance's product for the PC.  But do realize that the Mac version is only 3.0 and Nuance is already on Dragon 12.0 for the PC.  The products work similarly, but the PC product is definitely more mature.  Secondly, Nuance hasn't exactly figured out how to tap into the 'Macness' of OS X.  The software definitely works after a fashion, but sometimes behaves like a rude tourist, not always integrating well with OSX's feature set and is often a major resource hog.  What your get in the end is reasonable voice dictation/recognition software that definitely does the job, but is still a little rough around the edges.  ***AN IMPORTANT ASIDE: Nuance released this product a bit too early.  Prior to the latest software patch, it crashed often or would cause my Mac to hang such that I would have to force quit the program frequently.  This probably explains some of the more negative reviews on this site.  After the last software patch (and an upgrade of RAM), it now functions respectably on my machine.  That said, I would make sure that your Mac exceeds the suggested specs before you run out and buy this program.  WHAT'S IN THE BOX: The product comes with a CD, quick start guide, and a USB headset.  As equipment goes, the headset is meant for basic dictation.  The sound from the single earpiece is not audiophile quality (nor would you be expecting this).  The mic has more than good enough sound for voice dictation. It is reasonably constructed from plastic.  It is not the most comfortable headset I've ever used but was more than serviceable for dictation purposes.  SET UP: The installation was intuitive and nearly automatic, but for whatever reason took quite some time.  After installation, you have to set up your profile for voice recognition/dictation.  Each user needs a different profile, as the software needs to adapt itself to the quality of your voice.  This consists of setting up the audio source.  For reasons that are unclear to me, the default source--even with the headset plugged in--was the 'Dragon Remote Microphone.'  This would be good for, say, using your iPhone to dictate into the system, but will not work with the headset.  This needs to be changed with a simple toggle.  You choose spelling (American or British). You can then choose from a variety of accents from American (standard/inland Northern/Southern/teen),British, Indian, Latino, and Southeast Asian.  You then wait a while again for Dragon to set up the profile and load the spelling and grammar files.  After a quick microphone check.  You then proceed to voice training, where you can choose from a variety of passages from easy to 'medium' reading so that Dragon can get used to your voice.  It performs various calibrations and then sets up the profile.  You can then opt for Dragon to scan your old documents for unique vocabulary (a time consuming process that can be done later.)  When all is said and done, from set up to training, you should be up and running with Dragon within 45 minutes to an hour (so long as you save the document scan for later).  This may seem like a long time, but when you compare this to older versions of Dragon, it is actually pretty speedy.  THE EXPERIENCE: Dictating  with the Dragon software is definitely something that  has a learning curve. You have to get used to the quirks of the program. However, even with these quirks,  I believe you'll find that Dragon can still outpace even the fastest of typists. You will need to learn how to speak clearly so that the program can understand you, remember to speak with punctuation so that it is added within the text, and you need to learn how to correct text without using the keyboard, so you can gain maximum speed. Generally,  The program does a bang up job when it comes to standard dictation and voice recognition.  SIMPLE DICTATION: The experience is somewhat software dependent. If you're looking at straight dictation, the best program to work with seems to be Microsoft Word.  This is probably the  word processor most used in businesses and integrating with Microsoft Word is likely the highest priority for Nuance. Microsoft Word even has it's own set of integrated commands.  The same cannot be said of other word processors, such as OpenOffice and Apple's Pages, where the spacing is sometimes quirky and where capitalizations don't always occur automatically at the beginning of a paragraph and may even occur mid sentence.  Even with these issues,  I can still dictate by voice much faster than I can type, but this does add to the proofreading.  These kinds of problems are compounded in less conventional programs, such as Writer, where corrections can sometimes lead to dropped characters and can throw off the formatting.  Once you get used to use the system, Dragon definitely delivers on dictation. It is easy to use and set up and the dictation is fast and accurate.  (Note:  As you can imagine, the English language has many words that sound like or need to be spelled differently in different contexts.  No voice dictation system, even a smart dictation system, will be perfectly accurate at this point. After dictating, it is always necessary to edit carefully.)  COMMANDS: I do use Dragon to launch  and close programs occasionally. However, I'm not a power user when it comes to hands-free use of the Mac. I'm sure if someone put their mind to it, they could get Dragon to do pretty much anything they wanted it to do. However, one major criticism is that Dragon does not integrate with OS X in the same way that it integrates with garden varieties of Windows. I can launch Pages, for example, by saying,""launch Pages.""  But even in command mode, pages doesn't always close when I say, ""close  Pages."" Moreover, when I open Pages, I am able to select an old document, but it isn't very clear  how to get Dragon to open a new document. I gave up just hit the document button.  In Windows, all this runs more smoothly and more intuitively.  Dragon seems more at home in the Windows world.  However, it is quite possible that over time I will become more facile at getting Dragon to cooperate with OS X, however this was not necessary in the Windows version.  THE INTERFACE: I am a big fan of Apple's upper taskbar. It definitely keeps things simple and keeps all controls for all programs in one place.  I realize that Apple doesn't like clunky command bars, but even clunky command bars can serve a purpose.  Dragon's interface for OS X is a floating rectangle. There is a button to toggle the microphone off and on, change voice recognition modes, toggle dictation, and toggle spelling. It is perhaps a minimalist and elegant interface befitting  OS X. However, it is far less practical than the long, albeit somewhat unsightly, toolbar that is available for Windows users. Instead of simply  clicking on the thing I need to control Dragon, I have to toggle Dragon so that commands appear in the upper taskbar and then I need to find what I'm looking for one of the embedded menus. This may not seem like a lot, but having to use two to three clicks instead of one is no bargain in my book.  In the greater scheme of things, it may not add a lot of time, but it does add to the frustration of using this program. Unfortunately, on the Apple version, there is not even an option for Dragon toolbar.  CRASHES/HANGS: After the most recent update, I've had many fewer crashes. However, Dragon still occasionally freezes and has to be forced to quit. This happens more often when I'm running other programs. As noted above, my iMac is no slouch, with a quad core, i5 Intel processor with 12 GB of RAM.  There should be more than enough processing power to go around and with enough RAM to satisfy the most memory thirsty programs out there.  Nevertheless, I still get multicolored beach ball at times. This was far  more common when I tried to run Dragon with only 4 GB of RAM. But even after the RAM upgrade crashes and hangs  were still pronounced until Dragon updated their software.  Now I get occasional hangs, but  crashes are few and far between. When I first received the software  frequent hangs and crashes made the software nearly unusable. This was shocking to me  as Dragon worked far better on my older, dual core PC with 4 GB of RAM and the geriatric windows XP operating system. Happily, the combination of beefing up my RAM and the Dragon software patch seem to have cleared  up the bulk of the problems.  (One advantage of the Mac version is that I only have to force quit and restart Dragon when there are problems.  On the Windows version I usually have to reboot the system to clear up resource sharing errors, C+ runtime errors, and file sharing problems.)  That said, Dragon has a habit of not playing well with the other children. On my PC, Dragon also has tendency to crash, if I don't keep XP happy by shutting down and restarting at least once every two weeks. This is likely due to some kind of resource sharing conflict--possibly with Word itself--after Windows has been running continuously without a cleansing reboot. There are times, in Windows, where it won't allow me to save or open a user profile because another program is using the files (What other program uses these files?!?) The program can be temperamentally glitchy, but this is the nature of the beast at this point.  The fact that using Dragon (on Windows or the Mac) saves me incredible amounts of time doesn't justify the awful software issues, but it does mean that it is still incredibly useful and that I will continue to use this product.  CUSTOMER SUPPORT: Nuance is notoriously flimsy when it comes to personal, customer support. I did not contact customer support for this product, but in the past they offered a support ticket system free of charge for only 90 days. (This is far better than their old system, which--not unlike getting arrested--allowed for only one, unpaid phone call for support.)  Unless it is pathetically simple, phone queries basically generated an online ticket-type response system.  Not bad, but not all that personal and sometimes it is hard to solve such things on a glorified email system. (My guess is that they reserve the excellent phone support for their corporate customers.)  After 90 days you are basically out of luck unless you want to spend just less than 10 dollars for an online query or 19 dollars+ to speak to a technician on the phone. They do, however, have a large database of answered questions on their site and they also have a very active forum where some generous superusers can get you out of a whole heap of trouble. (I contrast this with other companies where a technician actually will spend some time on the phone and they don't drop you like a hot potato after 90 days.)  CONCLUSIONS: All in all, if you are looking for voice dictation software Dragon offers a reasonable solution for the home or business user. Dragon is still the best--and really only viable--option for home voice dictation that is available; that's why I gave it 4 stars. When it comes to crashes, voice control, and seamless integration with the Mac, however, Nuance still has a ways to go and definitely should have turned out a more polished product. Still, after the last software patch this is definitely an eminently usable product.  Finally, even though Nuance's Dragon still needs a little taming in either the Mac or PC world, it is still a major time saver and, at this time, is really the only available software for voice dictation that is available for the home user.

Because, let's face it, when your new OS throws the BSOD so often, you have to do something to make it look spiffy.  Freeze ups, crashes, BSOD's and crappy apps will make you long for the days of Vista.  NOT! After making a good stable OS like Seven, why not just throw a monkey wrench in the works.  If you have a new computer, don't thing upgrading will be painless.  You may have to update your BIOS and Drivers.  Expect Windows 8 to work with your iPad, iPod or other fancy devices--think again.  Luckily, instead of making devices work as a priority, they decided to throw in some software hoo-doo to make you run an emulation of an OS Past--like Seven or XP.  Because making a new OS isn't about giving the consumer a fun, fresh out of the box easy experience.  Nooooo sir! Call up the Geek Squad and get the Cheetos and Jolt Cola ready.  You SOL kiddo.  This was released in October 2012 and STILL no support for the iPod/iPad.  It is a game of Stalemate with you in the middle.  You lose!  When it does run smoothly, there are no shakes here.  Like 16 billion colors for menus and taskbars? FUGGEDABOUTIT! 256 colors for you on your Start Screen! Vaguely transparent task bar, more opaque.  Nothing pretty here.  The designs for the Start Screen are limited so it looks like a Hipster Art Student took LSD and barfed on your screen in 256 colors.  We are talking fugly here.  Unless you are a hardcore computer geek with a morbid sense of curiosity, hang on to your money and Windows 7.  There is no going back easily kids.  You don't want to truck with this monster.  Microsoft sure must be paying lots of people to jam magazine forus with fanatical zeal to scream that this is wonderful! Ask anyone in IT or any Geek and they will tell you to put the Kool Aide down.  This will go down along Windows ME and Vista as the Golden Turd of OS'es.",391

This version is no different, but I have to admit the interface really has changed.  You will spend a little bit more time looking for things that were more readily available before.  However, there are more ways to organize and save time in your email and calendar by color coding and linking to projects and personal/business.  Inviting attendees is the same, and now publishing or meeting online is easier. You are able to organize contact information in one place and then sub-divide it into work, personal, etc and also link this information into the other areas of your Office products.  I've always enjoyed using Outlook and the few times that I've had to work without it I've been lost.  This new version takes some getting used to, but I've really enjoyed the calendar sharing and the meeting inviting abilities on top of the others that I use regularly, like calendar, task list, contacts, email, and mail merge with other programs.

2125.0,150,5.0,"I have been waiting for the new update of the Mac version of Office. I have tried other alternatives, and they just don't work the way I would expect them to. Having used Microsoft Office for the PC in the past for all of my office needs, I could not find anything that worked quite the same on my Mac. Printing would be off, or text would not look right, and just a lot of small things that made me feel that I needed to keep looking for the right program to edit spreadsheets and documents on my Mac.  Behold: Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac! This is the newest version of Office for the mac! The settings and options I am used to having are all there! Commands have the same name I am familiar with! Documents and text look the way I would expect them to when I create/edit them and even when I print them! I felt at home!  The menu system does take a bit of getting used to. Instead of being a traditional Menu Bar like Office 2003 (what I am familiar with) it has a style more like Office 2007 - but with the menus detached from the main document window. This takes a little getting used to, but actually is much better with my wide screen monitor. I still prefer the old Office 2003 style menus, but I would say these are a bit more useful then the ones present in Office 2007. Also, the update system can be annoying if you set it to always check for updates. I get a pop-up window every time, but would have preferred if it checked in the background and then just let me know when new updates were available.  Installation took a bit. Not too terribly slow, but it was a bit time consuming. All of this was well worth it though, as any Office program I run starts up very fast! I was impressed with the loading speeds. I expected fairly fast loading due to the major efforts put into the new Microsoft products to decrease loading times, but I still expected it to take a bit longer. Word or Excel load about as fast as Firefox or any other lean program! MUCH faster than an alternative I had been using previously.  After using alternatives, and having become accustomed to the PC version - I found Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac to be a wonderful and necessary software suite for all of my document needs. I would definitely recommend this program if you want a solid and fully featured Office program for your Mac!",443

7365.0,490,5.0,"VideoStudio competes with Cyberlink PowerDirector, Pinnacle Studio, Sony Movie Studio and Adobe Premier Elements.  I have used the Cyberlink, Pinnacle and Adobe products.  You can find my previous reviews of these in my review history.  Corel is competing hard with these other companies to win your business, and has come up with several new features in this X6 version that the others do not (yet) have.  Motion Tracking:  You can select a part of a frame to 'lock' a word or other object to, and the object will move through the frame with the selection you made, like 'Adobe After Effects' does.  This is handy for simple things like a thought/text bubble following a person, a description or title for an object in a frame as you pan, or a PIP effect that moves with the subject in the movie (think Teletubbies TV effect on their 'screen', or tracking a hockey puck on the ice).  You can add multiple trackers in one clip.  By the way, the tracker information is stored with the clip, so if you use that same clip in multiple projects, you don't have to re-create your motion tracking.  Customize Motion:  You can now move things like titles, PIP, still images or other objects over the frame with keyframes.  Screen Capture enhancement:  I use this feature instead of something like Camtasia.  Corel has increased frame rates on screen capture from the 15 fps that it used to be, and now allows you to select 25 and 30 fps also.  This should make higher-motion screen captures smoother, and bring it closer to ""Camtasia Quality"".  Ultra HD:  4K Ultra HD is now available, if you can use it.  You will need some higher-end recording and playback equipment to make full use of this though.  Also, render times are much longer for this format.  Stop Motion enhancement:  You can now do stop motion photography directly with your Canon DSLR camera connected to the computer.  VideoStudio shows several camera settings like shutter, exposure, ISO, photo quality, etc.  Before you could only use your webcam of DirectX type device.  Subtitles with voice detection:  You use the usual narration feature to record a voice track for your video.  Then, in the subtitle editor, you can scan the voice track and it will create subtitle sequences based on when you pause in your narration.  You then must still type in the subtitle text or import from a subtitle file.  But the work of creating the subtitle objects at the proper timecodes is done for you.  Now... a voice *recognition* feature (voice-to-text) would be cool in a future version.  ;-)  Of the additional items you get with the ""Ultimate"" version, the included Boris Graffiti v6.1 makes an upgrade even more compelling if you do title animation like type on text, text on a path, jitter and randomization.  So there are several new features that make this version of VideoStudio compelling as an upgrade from X5 and previous.  The screen capture alone makes it useful to me.  Still, I like my Cyberlink PowerDirector for its more organized and intuitive user interface, and its quicker render time.  However for now, I may create some clips in VS X6 and use them in PowerDirector if I want the Motion Tracking or Custom Motion features.",1292

From my perspective, I have taken a lot of time to get used to the interface and explore the features.  As somebody who is admittedly not an expert in the subject matter, I find the interactive features to add new dimensions to the content that is presented.  And considering the amount of investment required to produce software of this caliber, I think this program is a great value.  Many have reported installation problems.  For PC use, I can report that I had no problems installing this on Windows 7.  The program required that I install Microsoft .NET framework 4 first, and the related updates.  But as of November 2011, it seems like some of the installation problems have been fixed.  The initial install allows you to access the basic features, but you will need to register to use things like the Atlas.  The actual space required to install the software is about 1 GB for a PC and 200 MB for a Mac.  You can use the interface to stream the data off the internet, and while there is some lag it wasn't significant for me.  But yes, if you want all the files on your local hard drive you will need to use all 3 disks and it will take up about 18 GBs.  That seems like a small price to pay for those who choose to have all the content stored locally.  This product is advertised to work for multiple devices.  While I had no problem with a PC install, it seems getting it to work on a tablet or iPod requires separate installs.  I will update this further once I confirm that my license key works for all the devices.  The best features for me are the Atlas, which integrates historical content from the Bible with geographical data and images.  This is the kind of resource that I think would be very valuable when visiting the various regions of Europe, Africa and the Middle East depicted in the Bible.

12797.0,775,4.0,"I feel like this software is a good balance of power and simplicity.  I've been a Photoshop Elements user for quite a number of years.  I've always been put off by the way you have to import files and how editing was always a bit of a separate task from editing and cataloging.  AfterShot Pro combines both really well.  It lets you use your native file folder organization directly yet you can still create custom ""collections"" of shots from multiple folders.  Although it has plenty of tagging and keyword capabilities, they aren't quite as straightforward nor are they the main focus in this application.  Editing photos is pretty easy with workflow tabs and plenty of easy 1-click types of adjustments.  Of course you can customize the settings in many of these.  As you probably know, software such as AfterShot has less of a focus on preset filters, effects and layers and more on the basic adjustments of lighting, color cast, sharpening and noise reduction.  There's also presets for lens corrections for specific camera models, and additional profiles can be downloaded for free.  Photo effect filter sets can also be purchased and downloaded.  If you want to create your own combinations, these can be set, saved, and then used later - even on multiple files.  That brings me to the next feature set which is really easy and powerful batch editing.  By saving presets, or even choosing the settings from a single picture you've already edited in AfterShot, you can reapply those same edits and adjustments to other photos.  Every filter and adjustment is saved with the photo and you always have access to this information.  The one thing that does bug me and the main reason for only 4 stars is that the interface can be kind of cluttered and the photo space small on a 1440x900 monitor.  I highly recommend something with more resolution.  Also, every time I applied a filter, even checking or unchecking a preset, I would have to mouse over the image, make a mouse click, or press a keyboard button for the image to redraw.

All joking aside, Streets & Trips 2009 is a fine enough product, but one that seems to be losing the battle for computer-based ""ordinary user"" mapping (the hardcore GIS folks don't even bother with such trifling mapping software). Coupled with a GPS unit, one can perhaps start to see where the usability factor starts ramping up over the usual online mapping providers, but even then, portable GPS units with built-in mapping and turn-by-turn directions are cheap enough to give real competition to Streets & Trips which requires a mobile computer together with all that wire going between it and the GPS unit.

It's always exciting to see what new features are added to old favorites, or to discover a totally new program that gives me new features or help me out.  However, with the new release of VideoStudio Pro X2 from Corel I can't see that many new features that interest me -- after using this for two months I am left with the question, ""Just WHY would I need to upgrade to this version?""  Of course the answer to that question is because of high definition video.  Good answer, but the truth of the matter is that HD is just not catching on -- yet.  It's technology that is slightly ahead of its time.  even Blu-Ray adoption is mediocre, as most people find that regular definition video is doing them just fine.  So when it comes to homemade video and productions one has to wonder what the big rush is to produce content in HD that will, in all likelyhood, be viewed on regular definition devices or uploaded to the 'net that will be compress it down to a more manageable size and form.  The program itself has many of the same features as the previous version, with the only real big change being added support for HD.  It's still got a lot of the quirks that the previous version had as well -- not exactly easy to use, and requires a lot of tinkering to get the basics down.  If you have anything short of a Core2 machine then you might want to pass this up as it will take a lot of processing power to convert videos and to use the program effectively.  Honestly, I would say that unless you have a burning desire to go HD you can get most of the features you will need for video editing from Windows Movie Maker -- a freebie from Microsoft.  No, you won't get all the bells and whistles -- but come on, how often do we use all those bells and whistles?  Most of us just want to store our home movies in a digital format.  The bottom line is this.  If you need HD, this is a good choice -- albeit it with a learning curve.  For the rest of us, stick with the older version and skip the upgrade or just use the free Windows Movie Maker.",724

The program also made itself ""king"" of all photo tasks on my computer, which I did not appreciate.  Like others have mentioned, the program overwrites your files without asking and without warning.  Not a big deal if you don't mind, but as is obvious from the other reviews, most people mind.  I have several different photo editing programs on my computer, based on how much editing I want to do and how long I want to spend.

For what it says it can do, it does do well, but it doesn't add anything to the Norton protection already there (and I would imagine that McAfee has a similar security suite that does all this as well).  Therefore, since it does what is says it does, I gave it three stars.  I deduct one star for lack of utility (it works, but why would I need it) and another for difficulty in installation.  The package says it can be installed without disabling other security software, but it would not let me install it unless I disabled Norton Intrnet Security first.

7580.0,502,5.0,"Corel Painter X3 is the most powerful paint program Corel makes and it functions a lot like Photoshop. That's a good thing. It means not having to relearn many of the tools. The floating palettes, menus and interface should be immediately intuitive to anyone who has used an Adobe product. Buttons and key functionality are even located in the same place on the screen and much of the terminology is the same. As a web professional, I use Photoshop every day and I know a lot of people who use Photoshop exclusively to paint with as well. It is one of the major tools for professional digital artists and game developers, so why would you consider Painter over Photoshop?  Whereas Photoshop has evolved into an all-purpose tool for digital artists, photographers, graphic designers, and web developers, Painter is a more specialized tool aimed at serious digital painters who want to paint. The brush options are extensive and bewildering, designed to feel the way natural brushes and media feel. For example, you can control the wetness, viscosity and evaporation rate of certain brushes and inks and paints. Experimenting with traditional media in real life would cost you quite a bit of money. To get the most of out the product, you'll need a Wacom tablet. Using just the mouse, it is unable to detect pressure and brush orientation.  The 943-page manual is available as a PDF from Corel's website. Corel also maintains an extensive YouTube channel for tutorials and showcases as well as on its own site. Corel offers a fully-functional time-limited demo for you to try out to see if it's right for you.

11613.0,742,5.0,"This day and age  many people have a lot of different devices for recording video. I, myself have a number, including two cell phones, and ipod touch and ipad, several android devices (including a few Amazon Fire tablets), a dash-cam in my car, and a couple of the small action cameras. Not to mention some regular style camcorders and a digital point-and-shoot camera that can take videos. I was given a drone for Christmas that had a video camera  but it now lives in the top of a tree somewhere in a Louisiana bayou (story for another time). Plus, I'm slowly working on transferring old VHS tapes to digital format. So I was happy to try out this new version of Magix Movie Edit Pro 2016 for the past thirty days. I've been using an older version of similar software from another brand (Corel VideoStudio Pro X3) and wanted to tryout something newer.  Installation was typical for a software package like this, and you need to activate the software and register it at the company's website (you'll need to set up an user account). The package also comes with a code that gets you some bonus content. I had problems with getting that. There really isn't any clear instructions as what to do with the code. I went out to the CATOON web site and couldn't figure out where to input the code. Doing a little research I finally figured out that you had to access the website through the web portal inside the software itself. Then I had the problem of how exactly to do that  the icon/button isn't marked very clearly (IMO). But I eventually found it (upper right-hand corner of the screen, black square with the letters CO and a blue dot inside the O). Since I had already set up an account with the Catoon store all I had to do is put in the code and check out. Make sure that the amount shown is $0.00 otherwise there was something wrong with the code. At first I was a  bit underwhelmed with the downloaded content, but after taking a better look at it  I changed my mind. You get three folders of stuff,  Videos, Songs, and Sound Fx. For the video, you get ten short abstract video pieces ranging from 5~27 seconds in length. You can use these for a variety of things. Songs, you get twenty pieces of music, and for Sound FX you get forty various generic sound effects. Not a whole lot of stuff, but some pieces that might come in handy. You can look around the Catoon store while you're there and check out some of the free stuff, but be aware  there is licensing on all the content there for the specific usage of the material. Be sure to first check to see what you're agreeing to before you use something you got for free.  The Magix Movie Edit Pro 2016 was easy to jump in and get started using  but then I've had experience using similar video editing packages in the past. Someone new to video editing will probably be facing a pretty steep learning-curve trying to use this software for the first time. The company has provided a fairly detailed 400 page PDF user manual to read, but my suggestion is to go online and check out the video tutorials that are available on the companys website. These short videos are more a overview of someone demonstrating many of the software's features than actual tutorials  but you do learn something from viewing them. I first worked my way through the software by having one of the videos open on one of my screens and the software up on the other, and following along as the video played. This is probably a good place to mention something that sort of irked me about the tutorial videos. There are three different versions of this video editing software available (Pro, Pro Plus, and Pro Premium). The tutorials aren't very clear as to what features are in what package (well, they sort of do, I just didn't pick up on it). So after viewing the videos before I actually got the software, I was a bit disappointed that the Pro version didn't include some of the features that I was really wanting to try out (screen capture for instance). Still, go check out the videos if you're just starting to use this software for the first time, or are considering buying it.  The interface and actual operation of the software was similar enough to what I've used in the past that I was able to get started with no problems. Like I mentioned at the start of this review, I've got a number of video device (too many really). The issue with that is there are a couple different video file formats each of those produce. But the  Movie Edit Pro can handle all of those. I'm able to import and edit everything. Some of the features I like with this new editing package are  the title / subtitle feature. I make a lot of video sideshows for people using the photographs and I found that titling images is something that a lot of people appreciate. Having the ability to choose a location for the text and changing up the look of the font is really helpful. I also like that you can choose a stock menu when you burn a project to a DVD or  Bluray.  I also have Magix's Music Maker 2016 Live on my computer, and like that the music files made with it can be directly used for this video editing package. It's great to make a custom soundtrack for a slide show in Music Maker and then simply drop it into the audio track in Movie Edit.  I could probably go on and on about the things I like with this software, but that's enough. I have to say I really enjoyed checking this out and think it will be something I'm going to keep using for awhile. I'd recommend it to anyone needing to edit the videos that they too probably have piling up on their computers and devices.  Just in case it might be helpful - I'm running this software on a five year old computer  a HP HPE-190t desktop with an i7 processor and 12GB of ram running Windows 7 Pro. I've got two monitors, a 27 and a 24 which works well as I can set the main program up on the larger screen and use the smaller one for the video pre-view window.",717

10252.0,649,4.0,"PC-based graphic artists have been hit with two frustrations in recent years - Adobe's heinous new pricing scheme, and Microsoft's slightly less heinous reworking of MS Paint. I had high hopes that this program would help address the first issue. No such luck. But it's an awesome Paint program.  WRT Photoshop - the program claims Photoshop compatibility, and this is true, inasmuch as it can open .psd files. It even preserves layers. What it doesn't do is bring in anything path- or object-based -- no splines, no fills, no reshaping, no manipulations that aren't bitmap/pixel rendering. If you thought the price for this as a Photoshop replacement was too good to be true, you were right.  WRT Paint - this does everything you ever wanted from that toy. Layers (as mentioned above), a much less useless zoom feature, all sorts of fun brushes and effects (with stylus pressure support), pixel-based transforms, and even a better-designed color mixer. Sweet.  Once I stopped expecting too much from it, the program was a lot of fun to play with, with a few annoyances. First annoyance -- the help function takes you to the help files for Painter itself, not Essentials. So, you will read about this cool feature, and then, at the bottom of the page, be presented with an apologetic ""Some features described in the Help are available only in Corel Painter 2015, and are not included in Painter Essentials 5. For more information about Corel Painter 2015, visit http://www.painterartist.com/""  (which is a store link). Essentials is the teaser for the more expensive program (which does support paths), and Corel makes no attempt to hide this. Second, as with all Corel's graphics programs, this software can only be installed once. Were you planning on changing machines any time soon?  Well, unless the first machine fails catastrophically, you can't take this with you.  Given the relatively low price of this package, I would still recommend it to budding artists and fingerpainting kids of all ages. It's not a professional tool, however, and doesn't really claim to be.  (Note - if you're looking for a real artist tool in this price range, check out Autodesk's Sketchbook Pro. That has a much steeper learning curve, and is still bitmap-based, but does a much better job of emulating a real drawing board workflow.)",1302

I had been expecting something complicated, having used Corel's other creative products before. The editor screen here makes it easy to know where the tools are and how to apply the tools, unlike some other home video software. What I really like is the large number of video input formats it supports, since I use a large variety of digital cameras and camcorders.  What I love is it supports the AVHCD format (versions 1.0 and 2.0), used by all the Japanese camcorders.  I run this on a Toshiba i7 laptop with Win7, and importing the highest-quality AVHCD files is a breeze. I have only used this for a little over a week, but so far it's been a solid piece of software.  One feature I think I'll take advantage of is the subtitle editor. Members of my family are hearing-challenged, so I think this will be a pleasant change for them, for me to add subtitles to the videos I force them to watch. :)  The packaging claims this program also supports the new 4k Ultra HDTV format. I don't have the resources to test this claim, but if it's true, that's nice, even though I'll probably never get to use it with this version.  I'm really have a good time with this program.

8007.0,527,5.0,"I've been a regular user of Adobe Photoshop for over 10 years. I still use Photoshop for most of my quick image editing jobs - because I am very comfortable with the menus, layout, and image corrections. But last year I added Corel Patinshop Pro X5 to my software list.  I ended up loving the HUGE set of plug-ins and one-click image enhancement macros.  This year's new X6 edition adds even more plug-ins!  So when I want to make my photos uniquely different I play with the dozens of different macros that Corel has.  As you'll learn, some of these same plug-ins for Adobe Photoshop cost more than the Corel software! So it's a deal in itself!  The biggest improvement that I noticed in the X6 version this year is the better menu system.  I'm starting to get a lot faster using Corel. This gets me using the software more often.  I'll be curious to see how much I continue to use Adobe Photoshop as the year moves forward.  The bottom line is for under $100 you can't find a better image editing program!  For those shoppers looking for image editing software, my advice is:  -- If you only edit images on occasion and just want to re-size, perform white balancing, or leveling - then GIMP is a free imaging software that will work for you.  GIMP is fully loaded with all the fundamental correction abilities that a basic image editor will require.  And the software is free.  Keep in mind that GIMP runs slower than Corel and Adobe... and doesn't have the plug-ins or cool macros.  Of course you can also use the online editing tools like Flickr and Picasa.  -- If you want to create exciting and sometimes wild adjustments to your photos (like adding noise, old time photograph effects, lens flares, HDR, blemish removers, wrinkle removers, and color filters) then Corel Paintshop Pro X6 is for you. And for under $100, this is a great deal.  -- If you are a professional and share files with other professionals; if you light to manually adjust your photos piece by piece; or want the fasting running imaging software, then Adobe Photoshop is for you.  At nearly $400, this is a huge jump in price. So you might need a strong reason to shell out the cash, when other software will do the job just as well.  Also Adobe Lightroom is another software offering - but this is just for image correction based on camera models and lens.  It's the most ""techie"" of the programs... is a bit dry and limiting.  People shooting for magazines and weddings often use Lightroom to perform preliminary editing that may have been missed while shooting.(color leveling, lens filters, etc).  Then Photoshop adds some more image effects, like sharpening and blurring.  -- I don't consider Adobe Photoshop Elements on the list of recommended products, even though it's quite popular.  For the price, it's offers very little features.  I feel they watered it down too much.  Summary.  Think of Adobe Photoshop for the paid professional, Corel Paintshop for the home hobbyist or part time professional, and GIMP or web-based editors for the occasional user.",1168

4673.0,312,5.0,"WordPerect X5 is an office suite consisting of WordPerfect X5 (Word Processor), Quattro Pro X5 (Spreadsheet), Presentations X5 (Mutimedia Presentation), and WordPerfect Lightning  (Digital Notebook).  This review will highlight some of the features of the WordPerfect Office Suite.  WordPerfect ----------- - QuickCorrect QuickCorrect (called AutoCorrect in Word) is a pretty standard feature in word processors nowadays but a feature unique to WordPerfect is SpeedLinks. SpeedLinks allows you to specify a ""Link Word"" (e.g. @Amazon) and a corresponding Web address to link to (e.g. Amazon's Web address). Every time you type in @Amazon, the ""@Amazon"" will be replaced with Amazon's Web address.  - Multiple File Formats Supported You can convert a WordPerfect file into Microsoft Word and other word processor formats such as WordStar, XyWrite, and DisplayWrite. If your document contains tables, you have to the option of converting the document into MS Excel, OfficeWriter, QuattroPro, and Lotus 123 as well.  - Frustration-Free I used Word for many years before I gave up on it almost entirely. I usually elect instead to create my documents in a plain text editor like Editplus, copy and paste it in Word, and ten add on the finishing touches, such as underlining, italics, and bold (which a plain text editor cannot do). The reason: formatting quirks (e.g. line spacing, indentation) in Microsoft Word can be absolutely exasperating! If you use Word on a regular basis, *you know* what I'm talking about.  Word processing not only works flawlessly in WordPerfect, it is incredibly easy to incorporate, format, and manipulate tables, pictures, and multimedia. I can concentrate on creating content without having to contend with software quirks.  Quattro Pro ----------- Quattro Pro is a full-feature spreadsheet program like Excel. However, There is a disadvantage of using Quattro Pro. Since the vast majority of people use Excel rather than Quattro Pro or any other spreadsheet programs, help resources are not as abundant as Excel. This will almost definitely not be an issue if you're using Quattro Pro for designing simple spreadsheet but it may be a concern if you're planning on designing more complex spreadsheets that involve more advanced features such as macros.  Quattro Pro is also incompatible with Excel. You cannot expect to easily migrate an Excel file in Quattro Pro and vice versa. If you're newbie on spreadsheet, my advice: go with Excel.  Presentations X5 ---------------- Presentations X5 works a lot like Microsoft Powerpoint. You can easily create presentation slide shows. Presentations X5 allows you to insert pictures, sounds, spreadsheets, multimedia files (such as MPEG, AVI), and other objects.  Extras ------ - Create PDF's New in X5 is a PDF Tool which allows you to turn any WordPerfect document into a PDF file. It can even convert image-based PDF files into editable content! Use it to add comments or mark up your PDF files. PDF files can be password-protected.  You can create high-resolution or low-resolution PDF's (high-resolution PDF's are best suited for printing and low-resolution PDF's are best suited for posting on the Web.) Note: PDF Tool is only available in the Standard and Professional versions of the WordPerfect Suite.  --- WordPerfect Office X5's forte is in its word processing program, WordPerfect. (Any wonder why Corel named its office suite after its word processing program?) I am very impressed by how easy it is to create and edit content in WordPerfect. Presentations X5 is a superb program as well. As for Quattro Pro, I do have slight reservations about recommending it to someone who uses its more advanced features, not because of any flaws inherent in the program, but because help resources are relatively scanty compared to Excel. All in all, I'm thoroughly impressed with the WordPerfect Office suite.

3524.0,224,5.0,"First off, I suppose I'll have to start by stating that I initially knew very little about the Japanese language, other than little snippets spoken to me from old Godzilla movies and various anime titles. To an outside viewer any foreign language can seem like a perplexing challenge to take on. It usually requires regiments of classes and years of complex study. When Rosetta Stone advertized itself as being able to teach foreign languages in an easy, concise manner, I was very skeptical. Now that I've spent a few months using this software in the small gaps that open up during my busy schedule, my skepticism has completely dissolved.  While I can't claim to have gained mastery of the Japanese language, I can say that I've learned quite a lot by utilizing this outstanding software. The program allows the user to work with a headset, in which you speak various words and sayings into a microphone. Feedback is given on how well you pronouce these words and compared alongside the audio samples of native speakers. The visual techniques employed by the software is also very effective; the mind is immersed in a catalog of recognizable images that methodically builds up a network of associations and helps to gently increase your powers of memory.  While most study involved in Foreign Languages can be ardous and painful, Rosetta Stone somehow manages to turn the ordeal into a pleasent experience. The program is very user-friendly without being overly patronizing, and it ran very smoothly on my system without any sort of technical problems. I was honestly expecting some sort of technical hiccup due to the complex nature of the programming, but one never presented itself.  But perhaps the greatest aspect of Rosetta Stone is it's casual-though-effective structure to teaching. I found that simply using the program for just an hour a day proved to show progress, with most lessons taking 30 minutes or less to complete. It doesn't force its users to dedicate large portions of their life time in order to make progress. The way the lessons are timed and structured, one could come closer to understanding a foreign language while still maintaining a full and busy life with career, friends, and family.  Overall, I found Rosetta Stone to an effective tool in learning Japanese. I've only had the time to get through level 1 of the course, but I'm already inching my way closer to speaking and writing the alphabets of Japanese, without sacrificing any time from my normal schedule. It is highly recommended to everyone.",684

However, if you are use to NT or Windows 2000 I would recommend XP Professional for the added administrative features. I've been using XP since RC1 and it has been rock solid. For a home pc it is the operating system of choice. For business users you can stay with Windows 2000 and do just fine as XP is just a more user friendly version of 2000. The XP interface is cleaner but offers nothing special. It takes a little while to find all your favorite old setup features as they are kind of hidden in different areas.

4896.0,326,3.0,"I am not a design pro, I don't have a lot of experience with other software of this type (successfully, at least) but I'm just not that impressed.  Here's why:  1) Installation took over an hour.  It's 4 disks, 4 programs, and 4 long winded serial numbers to enter correctly.  It's a pain. 2) Once installed, this still does not act like a ""suite"".  There are 4 different programs you have to find and learn to use. You can't quickly and easily move between the programs.  Another pain. 3) It's pretty limited.  I'm more familiar with Google's Picassa for manipulating photos, the one thing I do a lot of, as I use photos in blogs and websites.  I find myself still resorting to the free software to accomplish the basics because this software is such a pain to figure out how to use.  I just want to crop, sometimes increase shadows, add a watermark, and reduce the resolution to post them on the net.  That isn't a quick few clicks with this software, and I never have figured out how to add a watermark. 4) My partner has voiced complaints that it has duplicated photos and done some other weird stuff to the computer its installed on, resulting in excessive number of duplicate files.  It automatically wants to snatch up any images, and creates additional work in terms of just getting the job done.  The plus side?  It's kind of fun to play with.  I may create some digital scrapbooks for my granddaughter.  The ""paint"" portion is real limited, and the results are usually far from wonderful, so it's just a 'toy'.  It's almost like a sampler of digital imaging software in a simplistic form.  At least I could figure out some stuff on my own, whereas with the programs pros prefer, I was incapable of doing much of anything.  Who would like this software?  Someone who likes playing with their photos and doing digital scrapbooking or creating material for a traditional scrapbook.  Teens and young moms will probably find it more to their tastes.  For us ""grandma geek"" sorts, it's a bit too complicated for quick & easy use, and too simplistic to devote a lot of time learning to use it.  I'd rate it as ""okay"" but nothing too exciting.  It can do more than Picassa, for example, which is nice, but for the simple tasks of just managing photos and posting them to the internet, it's a bit too bloated.

4811.0,322,3.0,"I am writing this review of Dragon NaturallySpeaking Premium 11 using the program and the headset that came with this product, HS-GEN-B (analog). This program is reasonably responsive once you have set it up and trained it to your voice. I have been working with this program off and on for about five months now. I tend to use it when I need hands-off dictation, that is what I am holding reference materials, or shifting through papers and dictating off of them. I do find that I have to speak distinctly, because otherwise the program will begin to make errors. I also find that it takes a while to catch up with my voice if I'm speaking in normal cadence.  The headset is helpful but it comes with sound-jack plug-ins, which is to say, it does not use USB but the kind of colored sound jacks that you would find in for a desktop computer. This headset has recently been discontinued, but headsets shipped with future Dragon 11 packages might have the same plug ins and not be compatible, without an adapter, for smaller laptops and notebooks that might have only USB connections and not plug-ins for stereo and microphone.  I still find it more convenient to correct dictation errors and my own errata using a mouse after I finish dictating raw text. Still, the program is useful for what it sets out the: a program that will allow you to put text on the screen without much keyboard work. It does demand a fair amount of RAM memory at times, I find.  The ""Dragon sidebar"" does provide helpful hints as to which verbal commands to use, and I find them helpful. I am sure the later versions of the software will be easier to use. For now, this program will suffice for what it tries to do.",1170

3663.0,233,5.0,"The Good:  * Set it and forget it * Traditional firewall and scanners you expect from a suite and then some * Innovative features like anti-theft protection, keystroke encryption and wi-fi detector on your browser(tested on IE and Mozilla) * Provides Mobile security for many PDAs as well  The Bad:  * Anti-Theft protection could've been extended to do much more  The Bottom Line:  A great product from Trend Micro.  Once you install it, you forget that its even there.  It doesn't bug you for every little thing like other suites tend to do.  It provides a powerful protection silently in the background.  Of course you may choose to do scans manually.  It has firewall, virus scan and a tune-up scan.  This is also a great suite for laptops as its easy on the resources and provides Wi-Fi security on the browser's toolbar.  It will let you know if the Wi-Fi you are using secure or not, in addition to whether or not the website you are on safe or not.  The anti-theft lock feature is a mixed bag but is still a good addition to the suite.  In a nutshell, you set up a master password(which if you ever forget, they will email it to you.)  You have the option to lock a folder where supposedly you keep all the private data in.  If your PC/Laptop gets stolen, nobody will be able to access that folder.  All you need to do is go to Trend's website and report your computer stolen.  Once your lost computer goes online, that folder will always remain locked, even if they know the password to the vault file.  My only gripe is:  If its possible to lock one file, why not have the ability to lock the entire computer while you're at it?  However, that minor ding will not stop me from recommending this product to others as I hope I never get to use the benefits of anti-theft features.",622

801.0,49,5.0,"Having tried a number of different wireless network adapters that connect to the computer via the USB port I have found that this type of device is much better.  It is more reliable; and faster to give you a connection when logging into Windows. This adapter frees you from problems with sleep mode, screen savers, etc. that USB type adapters may have.  If you use Linux, Mac OS, etc. this device is a nice solution as well.  The installation program is slightly buggy, but I was able to get the device configured and it has worked flawlessly ever since.  If you have a device that has an RJ-45 Ethernet port and you want to connect it to an A, B or G wireless network this is the best way that I have found.  Internal cards that plug into the PCI or PCI express ports are also reliable and might be better for online gaming.  But I occasionally like to be able to move my adapter to other devices that have RJ-45 Ethernet ports like Game Consols, other computers, etc.  Many other companies make similar adapters that only use the B & G type networks.  This is the only device that I could find that can use type A networks that I use.  You can only connect to one router or access point at a time.  The only gripe that I have is lack of some encryption protocols.  I live in a rural area so encryption isn't too important to me.

The program will resize images as well as text files, but I think you should use dedicated image programs, even free ones, for resizing. This is the basic edition.

4633.0,307,4.0,I already had Norton 360 Premier on my computer which came with 25 GBs of online backup.  When I installed this it added 5 GBs to my total. I had one minor glitch with the installation but that was solved with a call to technical support which answered the phone as soon as I called.  When I went to install this I was taken to the Norton website listed on the online backup card and  and was asked to either create a username and password or log in using an existing account. I logged in and put in the code. I was asked if I wanted to install Online Backup and I said yes.  The one glitch I had was a warning that came up saying there could be a conflict between the Online Backup and Norton 360. I called Norton and they said there would not be a conflict so I went through with the install. It worked fine. I now have 25 GBs of online backup from Norton 360 and 5 GBs from Online Backup for a total of 30 GBs.  Using Online Backup is easy. You can choose what to backup. For instance you can check a box which says pictures or music or financial files or video and those files will be backed up.  After the one year is up you have to pay to continue the online storage.  This is something to consider if you need to backup things long term.  I found this easy to use.

The ability to control it remotely would be of use to people using their computer as an HTPC (home theater PC), which is not something I do. The ability to organize photos, music, and video would be of use if you don't already have them organized under another program, or (for photos) if it had Lightroom-type cataloging capabilities. The online storage would be of use if you don't mind paying for it after the first year, but if you're not willing to pay, it's not worth the bother.  HOWEVER, for those of you planning to take advantage of the free Windows 10 upgrade, you should be aware that *Windows 10 does not come with the capability to play DVDs.* It makes sense that Microsoft would not want to pay DVD codec royalties for every copy of the OS it's giving away for free.

423.0,23,3.0,"""Treasure in the Royal Tower"" was my fourth Nancy Drew game and my favourite so far. Out of the four games I've played (""Final Scene,"" ""Secrets Can Kill,"" ""Message in a Haunted Mansion, ""Treasure in the Royal Tower""), ""Treasure in the Royal Tower"" had the most satisfying plot, interesting characters, clever dialogue, and the most cool places to explore. Nancy is on vacation at a ski resort in Wisconsin built by an eccentric millionaire. The resort is built to look like a castle, complete with a tower that was imported from a chateau in France. French queen Marie Antoinette used to spend a good deal of time in the tower, and one of the hotel guests believes that the tower holds an important secret that could clear Marie Antoinette's name. When you arrive, a killer blizzard leaves everyone trapped in the castle, and the castle's library has been vandalized. Besides yourself, there are a number of suspects: Jacques, the Olympic ski instructor, Lisa, the photojournalist, Dexter, the caretaker, and Mrs. Hotchkiss, the eccentric Marie Antoinette scholar. As the game progresses you will learn a great deal about French Revolutionary history and Marie Antoinette in particular. The locations in the game are varied and realistic: an imposing lobby, a comfy lounge with a blazing fireplace, the ransacked library, Nancy's room, castle corridors that lead to dead ends, twisty stone stairwells, an antique elevator, a shed, a secret garden and the Royal Tower. Along the way you'll slip along secret passageways, climb elevator shafts, and ascend into the Royal Tower to find Marie Antoinette's secret, but...BE CAREFUL. Someone doesn't want you to succeed in your search: you are deliberately trapped in the elevator, hit over the head, and locked outside to freeze to death. Only your quick thinking and detective skills can save Nancy! Buyer Beware: I *loved * this game, but I have to give it only three stars because I had HORRIBLE problems getting the game to run. It would crash constantly in the middle of conversations or leave me stuck at a certain point in a hallway before giving me an error message of ""Invalid CHUNK file."" I had to restart the game 25-30 times before I could beat it, and it would cause my computer to crash as well. There is no patch available on HerInteractive's website. I changed a number of settings and configurations and the problem didn't go away. The most frustrating thing was that it wouldn't let me beat the game: after the villain revealed their identity, a chase scene was supposed to follow, but the computer would never return control to me and the baddie got away every time. When I selected the ""Second Chance"" feature, the game would inevitably lock up and my computer would crash again. Very, very frustrating.",142
4419.0,290,2.0,"Corel PaintShop Photo Express 2010 has a slick looking but unconventional interface and very little functionality. In fact, common free photo editing software features much more functionality. I believe it is intended for people with very little experience with computers and no experience with other photo editing software. However, for the rest of us using it is mostly an annoying experience.  If you launch it by selecting a new photo and then right clicking you still cannot edit that photo as you can with basically all other photo editing software. You have to use the import functionality and import folders with photos. You edit photos by selecting them and clicking ""Edit in Express Edit"". Here you can straighten, crop, fix red eye problems, and use auto fix. However, there is no batch editing functionality, no resizing, you cannot import bit maps, no pen tool, no library of filters, no magic wand, no marquee tool, etc.  I should add that by adding photos to the tray you have some limited resizing options (small/medium/large).  Windows Live Photo Gallery is a free tool photo editing tool with all those editing features and much more. I am not referring to Windows Photo Gallery which comes pre-installed with Vista and is also pretty useless. I am talking about Windows Live Photo Gallery which is free and you easily can download.  After using an editing tool in Corel PaintShop Photo Express 2010 you click the Apply button to apply it and see the effect. When you leave the editor or go to the next photo your work is automatically saved to disk without prompting you. You can restore the old photo by opening up the editor again and pressing ""Revert to original"". Basically, Corel Photo Express 2010 automatically saves your stuff (whether you want that or not) but you can always revert back. This is good for users who don't understand the concept of file and save. However, it makes it virtually impossible to use other photo editing software in conjunction with Corel Photo Express 2010 and you are running the risk of destroying photos. Corel Photo Express 2010 will over write your work without your explicit permission one way or another.  Other things that annoyed me were; it is slow, it sets itself as the default photo editor upon install without asking for your permission, the install took a long time, there are new updates very often, and you cannot use save as to save file/photo wherever you want on disk. You can only save to folders you have imported.  You can use Corel Photo Express 2010 to create little projects like a Photo Book, cards, collages, calendars, and slide shows. To get nice results you need to create these projects and then order them on-line (rather then trying to print them yourself). I thought that the functionality for automatically uploading pictures to face book or send photo emails was nifty but not essential functionality. When you upload to face book it asks you for your user name and password and creates an album called ""Corel Uploader Photos"". If you find the face book up loader annoying that functionality has some value to you but I would not pay for it.  In summary, I can maybe recommend Corel Photo Express 2010 to the computer illiterate but with reservations. For all others it is definitely a DON'T BUY.",1134
5632.0,377,4.0,"I have used Kaspersky for 2 years and really liked it but the 2011 was starting to take up half of my laptop's resources and started to have ""application launch"" errors so I opted to install the 2012 a couple of months before the 2011 subscription expired.  Since I use the 3 license version, I have installed Kaspersky on my 2007 Dell Vostro 1000 laptop (1GB RAM) w/Windows XP Home, and my 2004 Dell Dimension 8300 (2.5GB RAM) w/Windows XP Pro - both with 120 GB hard drives. See below for my HP Mini 210-XXXX netbook install.**  I would like to say the installation had a quirk in it so will give some helps here:  THIS IS FOR WINDOWS XP: After the install program verified and extracted files, I agreed to two separate agreements, then it checked for program compatibilty and said it would automatically remove Norton Live Update (I have Norton Systemworks but not anti-virus). Then you are told that you have to reboot ""to continue the installation"" and are given Three (3) choices:  1) Reboot NOW and continue to install  2) (don't reboot) Click Continue but your install might fail.  3) Cancel the install.  When you choose ""1"" it reboots then makes you agree to the same two agreements, say to automatically remove the incompatible files/programs and choose 1, 2 or 3 again.  Also all of the programs in your systray are back again after the instructions had told you to close them.  If you chose 1 again, the same thing happens over and over again -- So choose 2 AFTER the first reboot. AND I didn't think to close the programs the second time but had NO problems occurred with either computer.  You really don't want to wait to install a new version of the software because you have to update the databases from whenever the program came out -- like July of 2011 or before.  Mine took about 8 or more hours with 4 or 5 updates.  I think it didn't do them all at once.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Netbook install: I have an HP Mini 210-xxxx netbook with 1GB Memory, 250GB harddrive, Windows 7 Starter OS. After going to the website to download the software, the install was very easy, did not have any of the quirks above, only asked for agreements to the installs and, once installed, the updates were very quick.  It is a faster computer so everything was faster.  ALSO, I had to purchase another 1PC license of this same program to install on a new desktop with Windows 7 Premium.  It was fast and had the same type of install.  Both the new computer and the year old netbook have a different interface icon --- rectangle that looked like and old monitor and flat desktop design with icons on the front and side.  This was the same for both of my computers that use Windows 7.  The icon for the Win XP OS is round.  What I like is the program sets everything up for you and you don't have to choose all of the settings but you can go in and do that later if you want.  There are many features and programs available -- see the information on the Amazon's product page.

12682.0,569,1.0,"For software where you can pick up free versions, like 7-zip, I'm surprised Corel has this retailing for $60. Even winrar comes with a trial that never expires, but it will nag you every time you run it. On top of this, you can purchase it online for half the cost of this.  Otherwise, it installed easily enough and it is now my default unzip software. I was happy with it until this morning....  When I logged onto my computer, it said an update was available. No problem, I said to go ahead and download/install the update. After the install, it took me through the installation wizard. I was a little nervous because this is when extra software likes to piggy back onto your computer.  Sure enough, after the install some colorful, round icon appeared on my desktop. I was upset because 1) this is paid software for crying out loud. Fine, try to sneak stuff in when it is free, I get that you need to pay the bills. But this wasn't free, this was $60!! And then even worse is 2) it never prompted me to install this software. Usually when I update Java I catch that it is trying to install a toolbar and I tell it not to. With this, it didn't even give me the option, it just installed it hoping I wouldn't notice.  I immediately uninstalled the new software, but when I got to work I noticed my Chrome (which syncs settings with my home computer) now had a new home page. Needless to say, I'm not happy.  Honestly, I didn't realize until now that WinZip is owned by Corel. Upon the realization I muttered, ""That explains things."" I've had nothing but bad luck with Corel ever since they bought Word Perfect. I would have skipped this completely if I had noticed who sells it now. The fact they obscure their name from the product is rather telling.",93

I clicked on the ""Renew Now"" button and went through all their steps, never being aware that I was being switched to their Premier eddition for 2 more devices and only one year. When it finished I checked the number of days left on the license and it showed only 366. Not only did it upgrade me without me wanting it, but it ate my 41 days. Contacted customer support, which tried to appease me by adding the 41 days, which never happened. I requested to be escalated to a supervisor, and I am still waiting for a call back. They requested 48 hours to resolve the issue! Unheard of! If I treated my customer this way I would not have any customers. Stay tuned for the supervisor response. My advice is to get something else, or instead of renewing the subscription buy a new version from Amazon and install it after your old license expires. Update: Support didn't call back within the promissed time frame, instead they called Sunday morning and sent an email, nice trick, they know most people are not available at that time. What they asked for was the link to the renewal site, I told them the same thing as before, the product has been updated, the link is not the same!

7270.0,485,1.0,"I recently was ""upgraded"" to Office 2013 and I wanted to post my evaluation for anyone considering such a move.  I primarily use Outlook, Excel, Powerpoint, and Word on my work laptop.  Outlook is slow and buggy.  Problems I've encountered are lock ups as well as odd issues like my signature sometimes not working correctly.  Excel seems largely OK but certainly no better than before.  Word is a bit harder to use than before as they constantly feel the need to move stuff around.  Powerpoint is an absolute disaster.  I've had more Powerpoint crashes since ""upgrading"" than my lifetime total prior to the changes.  Stability is clearly not a priority for the Powerpoint team.  Funny enough I was told by IT that this is a known issue and they sent me a link on how to fix it on the Microsoft website.  The link on Microsoft's own website to the ""solution"" was broken.  These guys are clearly a joke.  If you can avoid this ""upgrade"" I'd highly suggest it.  For my personal laptop I continue to use LibreOffice with no issues and it's free.",896

They have not only been a lifeline, but they have been the central device in operating the computer. Microsoft has done that well since Windows '95 became popular you really had to own a Windows or a Apple computer. But, there have been some ups and downs with the previous versions from Windows 7 and Windows 8. Nevertheless, they have decided to merge all of the best of Windows XP and Windows 8 with Windows 10. This operating system is a bit more streamlined, than with the bulky desktop menu from 8 & 8.1. Nevertheless, it is a good operating system that has a lot to offer from a simpler menu, that return to the classic format of Windows before. My one gripe about this one though is that it can take more time to load on older computers with Windows 7, other than 8 & 8.1. Still it is a good operating system for the money.

7726.0,510,2.0,"I've used quicken since the late '80s and loved it. I really loved when they added the ability to attach documents to a transaction. Now when you attach a pdf document, you get an icon on the screen, you can't see if it's the correct attachment. Worse, when you go back to check information on your attachments, you have to open quicken, open the transaction, open attachments, then click on the attachment to open the document reader to see the attached document. If you have more than one attachment, you have to open each one separately until you find the one you're looking for. The mobile app would be really nice, if it worked. I used it fine, with most accounts, for a couple months; then the new year turned the calendar and quicken wanted me to upgrade to something I'd already been using for months. It wouldn't sync until I did, problem is, it wasnted me to sign on with the old account, but when I tried to do that, it wouldn't. I lciked for it to send me the password, even though I know what my old password was, but it wouldn't send me the necessary ""code"", so I resent, which was my only other option. well that errased everything from my phone app. I tried contacted tech support, first via online chat. I was 32 in line and waited 45 minutes for the count down to me being next, then got a message that no one was available to try again later. So I submitted my question to the call option and they sent me a number to call. I waited 1.3 hours, and never got anything but ""we will be with you shortly"".

3291.0,209,5.0,"First (and most importantly) I must point out that WordPerfect Office X5 is available for about the same price. Currently, you can find new copies of both X4 or X5 for under $40.  So I obviously recommend getting the newer edition for the same. But I have not tested X5, so here are my comments on X4:  I have always loved WordPerfect, and as expected I love X4. For almost 2 decades now, WordPerfect has earned a well-deserved reputation for excellence, and in my opinion it's much better than Microsoft Word or putting together a quick Word document.  I also strongly recommend Open Office, an open source, completely free office suite. I've used Open Office almost exclusively for the past 5 years, and it's great for ""light"" word processing, and it's spreadsheet is more than adequate. However, if you are a heavy user, need templates like label templates (Open Office is not great at this), or need somewhat sophisticated word processing functions (like image integration), WordPefect is hands-down the best in my opinion.  Additionally, WordPerfect opens any PDF into Word Perfect. It saves in just about any format (including .docx). Others have touted the optical character recognition (OCR) feature, which can convert a scan to text. This in itself is actually not a big deal - almost every scanner has bundled software that can do this. But having it build into the word processor means you can take a JPG image (such as a scanned receipt) & convert it back into text.  If you already have X4, I doubt that I would actually recommend upgrading to X5 - I don't plan on it. But if you're looking for a new word processor, I would suggest checking out X5. As for X4, I give it an easy 5-stars.",80

Why then can I enthusiastically recommend Rosetta Stone Italian?  In a word, it is fun!  If you are not familiar with their approach, Rosetta Stone immerses you in the language through photos, repetition and contextural clues.  The photographs are beautiful,  the voiceovers are rich, the challenges interesting.  You learn by doing, repeating and adding variety.  It is like being dropped in the middle of Italy with nothing but your time and your willingness to learn.  In the beginning, it is easy to build your vocabulary, as you respond to prompts.  Later as you build, you learn more grammer, the same way you learned English, through example. If you are patient and work hard, more and more puzzle pieces will fall into place. Though I am in the early stages of the process, I have no doubt that I can get a good working understanding of the language over a period of months if I am diligent.  Is Rosetta Stone worth it?  I haven't tried all the programs but have purchased Instant Immersion and Pimseluer but I have found they do not hold my interest like the Rosetta Stone version.

2883.0,142,3.0,"I have never been especially fond of Outlook, but I was willing to give it another try with this version in the hopes that my previous complaints had been addressed. I can't say I am especially impressed with this version either, though there are some good things I can say about it regardless.  I have been using Outlook in the workplace as a standard for years now. It integrates with MS Office (another standard in the office, though I use something different at home) and it generally gets the job done, though it is slow about it. I have found that Outlook 2007 is no exception in that regard - this is not a nimble application and it takes a lot of memory and resources to run well. If you have a lot of memory and space that's not really a concern, but it is something about which to be aware.  MS has always done a nice job of putting together applications with a pretty front end, and Outlook has almost always led the way in that regard. Though pretty, Outlook suffers from a very confusing layout in terms of where to find various configuration settings. Making a preference change is rarely just a couple of clicks away; invariably it either requires knowing up front where things are or it requires a lengthy search for the desired setting.  Outlook 2007 adds RSS feeds, a nice feature for those that use them. To be honest, I have not tried this feature so I cannot comment on it. That said, its availability is a nice thing and is something to consider if this capability is something you need or desire.  I fiddled with the Business Contact Manager portion of the application and to me it feels like a light CRM implementation running on the local box. This is a nice thing to have, but unfortunately it is not something I personally need. For a person who relies on keeping track of contacts, sales and other vitals, I can see this as being a very useful tool.  I do appreciate the fact that Outlook 2007 seems to be more stable than the last version I have used, but I do still get the occasional hang when connecting.  Outlook 2007 is a nice package and with the integrated BCM it is a good tool for people who need to keep close track of their contacts.

5262.0,355,2.0,"Current Office 2007 users won't find any surprises in the 2010 version: the interface is the same tabbed interface that remains a mixed blessing --at best-- for those who were experienced users of Office 2003 and earlier versions, and are still a little awkward with the tabbed/ribbon interface. Even with minor tweaks, Office 2010 offers essentially the same user experience as Office 2007.  Installation of Office 2010 on a desktop computer(4 GB RAM, 3GHZ Intel dual core processor) running Windows 7 Professional (and with an existing Office 2003 Professional version already installed) took about 20 minutes. Installation was trouble-free. Although the document history entries in the Windows start menu were erased after the install, the recent documents history were available within each of the Office applications. I don't use Outlook for email at home, but do use it for calendaring. All of my existing calendar entries and display/printing preferences were preserved and displayed immediately in Outlook; it also recognized my preference to start Outlook in the calendar view).  While the interface is familiar, application launch time is slightly faster, and there is improved feedback to users on recent files accessed in a navigation pane that appears under the File tab.  So, with a familiar interface, a problem-free install and apparent improvements in navigation and responsiveness...why 2 stars? Because the Office Professional suite is very expensive. The only reason I'm doing this review is because I had access to a deeply discounted purchase price via an educational licensing agreement.  But if you are currently running an earlier version of Office, I can't offer a single compelling reason to sink anywhere from 220 dollars (for a product key to activate the trial versions on new PCs) to more than 400 dollars (for a version delivered on DVD) for the consumer retail pricing. This suite is overpriced no matter how you slice it, and the lack of an upgrade price and package --which Microsoft touts as ""simplified""-- makes it more so.

Alternatively, if you have an affiliation with an educational institution that has an academic licensing arrangement, you should have a access to a very reasonably priced Professional version. Many businesses also have arrangements for ""use at home"" versions at deep discounts. Consider this also.  Otherwise, unless you're just a ""current version junkie"" who enjoys having the latest and greatest version of every application, I can't offer a good case for spending this much on a set of tools that looks, feels and performs almost exactly like its predecessor.",743

315.0,17,5.0,"Great 8-port switch.  I've owned it for over a year and it remains just warm to the touch. I have several ports at a gig and several at 100FDX.  I leave everything at autonegotiate.  There were a couple times where I switched off autonegotiate on a port and a particular PC because of an intermittent link outage and I was suspecting a problem with the autonegotiate.  But in the end, both times ended up being the same RJ-45 plug at the PC end of the 60 foot CAT-5 cable.  After finally cutting it off and crimping on a new connector, my intermittent problem went away.  This was one of my gig links.  My system maxes out at 450 Mbps point-to-point so I can't test at gig speeds.  Inserting the switch did not make any difference which is good.  One time, I configured three ports in two VLANs, (i.e. port 1 tagged to VLAN 2; port 2 untagged to default VLAN; port 3 tagged to VLAN 2 and a member of the default VLAN).  I could not get it to work with my PCs but I believe my NICs were not working properly with VLAN tags because Wireshark on all three computers never showed me a tagged frame even when I ran straight cable between two PCs configured for tagged VLANs.  In any event, while going through all these configuration changes on the switch, it never locked up or acted strangely.  The unaffected ports outside my little VLAN test remained functional.  So the only gripe I have with small devices like this is that they are too light.  They are at the mercy of the weight of the cables plugged into them.  They need lead in the bottom to hold them in place.  Alrighty then.",288
4996.0,333,1.0,"I know, giving a product one star because it fails at one feature that not every user needs may seem unfair.  But everyone knows Amazon's rating system is utterly subjective -- and for me, this one failing on the part of Quicken Deluxe 2011 is extremely annoying and devastating.  I had been using Money 2006 for several years.  As everyone knows, that product line was discontinued due to lack of demand.  I decided to get Quicken Deluxe 2011, which promised Money file compatibility.  While waiting for Quicken to arrive from Amazon, I uninstalled Money 2006 to reclaim some disk space.  To my great distress, I discovered, upon launching Quicken, that Money must be present on the system for Quicken to import the Money file!  According to the dialog box, ""Microsoft Money 2007 or 2008 must be installed on your computer before we can import your Money file.""  Okay, so maybe Money 2006 wouldn't even have worked, so it probably wouldn't have made a difference in my case.  But this is just absolutely ridiculous.  My Money file has no password protection, and I just don't see why Money is required to be installed for Quicken to read the file.  So I decided to give Quicken a spin anyway to see if it was worth my time to start from scratch.  When I clicked on that big ""Get Started"" button, Quicken started downloading an updated financial institution list.  After 10 minutes, it was still doing the same (the status indicator was simply moronic and indicated little).  I stopped out of that, and clicked ""Get Started"" again, this time Quicken began downloading a program update, but then nothing happened.  At this point, I decided to write up this review.  One other thing I also noticed is, after I ran Quicken for the first time, my quad-core PC, which had always been zippy and extremely responsive in everything, has begun to show some random slowdowns, which reminded me of the days when I ran Symantec's awful Norton Anti-Virus software.  I really wonder if Intuit installed some background services that have a significantly negative impact on my otherwise optimized system (Win 7 64-bit).  As you can see, my getting-started experience with Quicken Deluxe 2011 has been entirely negative.  I regret having wasted almost 40 bucks on a competely useless program.",70
3443.0,220,5.0,"The Rosetta Stone programs are wonderful for anyone who wants to self-study a language. The lessons move along well, but they also repeat words and phrases enough that you can absorb them.  I have installed Rosetta Stone software on both a PC (WinXP) and a Mac (OS-X), and have not had a problem on either system. Installation went smoothly and everything worked the first time. Installation does take a while, though, so expect to spend at least 20 or 30 minutes to get up and running.  Chinese is a difficult language for me, so I have struggled more with these lessons than with other Rosetta Stone courses I have used. I like the fact that I can review the lessons until I feel comfortable with them.  You will get out of this course what you put into it.

Although the product wasn't developed for MAC platform it does perform well but doesn't offer any of the MAC like interface setup.  As far as the language learning, the product performs well. It starts off easy with matching of words to pictures and quickly builds to speaking and matching more complex language sentences. I like how the product feels up to date with the images and the over all look and feel. I really like the ability to speak back to the system so that it can verify how I'm pronouncing the words and sentences. I also like the audio companion feature that allows you to take your learning on the road with an MP3 player.

For very basic ""When I die, I want these things to happen"" help to give those who survive you, WillMaker fits the bill nicely. It's easy to use, straightforward, and probably exactly what an average person living in the United States needs.  Outside of that, though, it's probably a better starting point to take to someone who is an expert in estate planning. For instance, WillMaker has a very limited ability to get a trust going, but isn't remotely close for setting up springing trusts (for example). If you have a very large estate, WillMaker isn't going to do the hand-holding you might need to understand the tax implications of estate maintenance and distribution. (Though in fairness, if the latter describes your situation, I'm going to guess you're not trusting everything to a $30 program you bought on Amazon anyway.)  One of the unexpected features that impressed me, was having documents for temporary guardianship of a minor, foreign travel authorization, even pet care directives. I also liked that you get some ""everyday"" documents, like promissory notes, and bills of sale.  All things considered, I think this is great for anyone who doesn't have complex estate planning needs. Personally, I'd consider having an attorney or paralegal review the documents you produce, and I'm not so sure about using WillMaker for any kind of trust, but otherwise, it's a really nice value.",1089
1694.0,124,5.0,"My original review follows but since so many people are having problems with this product I thought I would share some helpful advice based on my experience.  My original review was based on working with an XP machine and nothing attached but my video source, MP3 player and portable video device (one at a time).  It worked flawless.  Now that I have worked with it more I have had some of the same frustrations others have expressed but have located the source of the problem.  The software hangs, can't be stopped using process manager or with any other tools, etc.  However, this only occurs when I have my SanDisk usb thumb drive attached.  As soon as I pull it out everything works fine.  Plug it in and things hang almost immediately.  Same thing with an external usb hard drive (Maxtor).  As soon as it is unplugged everything is fine.  Working without any usb hard drives it works perfectly.  For me this is not a problem as I just work and save things locally and then transfer them to the usb drive later after closing the program if I really want it onto the drive.  I'm guessing that is the difference between those who have glowing reviews and those who think it is trash with nightmarish problems.  I have experienced both and at least now have control of the experience so I always have a positive one.  Hope this helps others experiencing some of these problems.  *** Original review *** Installation of Easy Media Creator 10 was straightforward and I had no problems.  After a quick reboot I was glad to find there are significant improvements over previous versions.  Somehow they have added more options while increasing the ease of use.  This is no easy task as added options just increase choices and the complexity of the program.  Of course it has all the basic features you would expect from a consumer grade product but it also has several more advanced items that you might not expect.  While it does not reach the point of being an appropriate product for professionals, it never claims to be either.  Instead it is simply one of the best high-end consumer grade media suites available.  This being said it does not alienate the true novice but has many wizards and a clean interface so people with very little experience in media creation, enhancement, conversion, or other tasks can easily get the results they want.  The software did exactly what I had expected with just a few of exceptions.  The HD and Blu-ray support is not as extensive as some other competitors.  If this is a major factor for you then you may be disappointed.  The AutoFix in the photo enhancement section did fix exposure and sharpness but the color correction could get severely off if there was also an exposure adjustment.  I tried AutoFix on a picture of a Moon Jellyfish stranded on the sand.  The clear jellyfish had some light tinges of color due to refraction of the sunlight.  The sand was a dark gray color.  By the time the AutoFix had adjusted the photo the jellyfish was appropriate but the sand was changed to a surreal bright purple.  Finally, the propaganda for the product indicates that you can create ringtones from your favorite sound files.  Despite the instructions in the help file I was unable to do so and found that one of the choices that, according to the help file, was supposed to be there after a right click was not one of the choices available.  On the other hand parts of the program worked better than expected.  The panorama creation tool was one of the easiest I have used and did an excellent job.  Of course, I did start with good photographs to begin with.  For the video editor in you the package includes both CineMagic, a video editor directed more toward the novice, and VideoWave which is a more complete editor for more demanding projects.  Finally, the audio conversion tools were excellent.  The bottom line here is this software is highly recommended to everyone from the novice user to the serious hobbyist.  For this group of users it is the best suite of products I have worked with.",721

I own a Nikon D90 and it can shoot better color photos in low light like no film camera ever made.  But B&W, without software manipulation, is a joke.  As a result I've used a Panasonic LX3 for many years in what they call ""dynamic B&W"" mode.  The problem is that the LX3 is lacking in several areas compared with a DSLR or a film camera.  What I've wanted was some software that would allow me to quickly change a color photo to dynamic B&W.  I didn't want to have to learn Photoshop.  Just load, click or two and be done with it.  And THAT is what the newest version of Tiffen DFX does with its new film modes.  I can now return to my D90 and leave the LX3 for those times I need a small camera.  If you're a former user of film cameras and have longed for look and feel you used to get then give this software a serious look.  There are many filters that mimic the appearance you'd get from specific film brands/types, from Agfa to Kodak. Previous versions didn't have the same robust film effects as v. 3 (which is why I forgot I had the earlier versions).  Don't expect Tiffen DFX to feel polished as you use it.  Just use it for what it does.  Even though I'm extremely displeased with the software's interface (I'd take my rating down to a 3 - it's that bad), I realize there are many other types of users besides me with different needs.  So with that in mind, I give this 4 stars.  There's a lot of power here for many different types of users.",973
8354.0,541,5.0,"I always run hot and cold on these photo and video editing programs. Some programs offer too much flexibility (Photoshop), while others completely fall short (I'll let you fill that one in). Some provide too many additional add-on features, some provide none. With PD5 Ultra, Cyberlink has hit the sweet spot for me, as I am not a professional photographer, but want to be able to manage and edit my work.  Installation was easy and smooth on my WIndows 7 64-bit computer (yes, it's got native 64-bit support). Start-up is very quick, and the interface is excellent - a neutral grey that makes it easy to work with your photos. Importing is easy and relatively quick, letting you get to work almost right away.  There are five main sections: library, edit, slidewshow, print, and adjustment.  The Library section is great. It's basic, but really works nicely and smoothly, gathering all my photos into one easy-to-navigate and searchable place. It's often the libraries that I dislike the most in these programs, but I'm very happy with the one in PD 5.  Adjustment lets you tweak thinks like white balance, color, tone, tinge, etc - you'll be familiar with these as they're settings found in most cameras. Don't want to go manual? There are a huge number of presets available as well, for those that like to grab and go Instagram style, and they're all quite good. An excellent and well balanced set of tools overall.  Edit provides the full suite of tools one would expect; object removal, merge, frames, effects, etc. For the most part, the effects are excellent and varied. The extract tool works fairly well (using a lasso or smart-tool) and the ability to tweak the results is a welcome feature. Object removal works well too, though depending on the subject matter it can struggle from time to time.  Slideshow and print are simple and what you would expect: ways to build slideshows or set up printing.  Honestly, the program is too deep to list everything it can do in one place. Cyberlink provides a bunch of tutorials that are set up to help beginners and experts alike get the most from the program - and there's a lot to get.  It runs rock solid, looks great, has a suite of excellent tools and allows beginners to get going while more advanced users can dig deeper. A fantastic program, a great choice and now my go-to photo editing software.",927

10946.0,699,3.0,"If you are already using Office 2013 there is not much new and no compelling reasons to upgrade. In fact there's probably more reason not to upgrade, since unlike earlier versions of Office, this version replaces 2013 so you cannot install the two versions on the same computer. If you are running older versions of Office it might be worth upgrading and you'll be able to install Office 2016 along with the old version to easily compare and see the differences for yourself. I thought touch support (ink and drawing with finger or pen is new though), dark theme (black theme is new which isn't a big leap from dark gray), cloud support were new features but they already existed in Office 2013 so the user interface is pretty much identical. The only new features I really noticed was cloud support was a lot more evident and the default place to save your Office files since Windows 10 does the same thing. It defaults to saving your stuff in the cloud unless you tell it otherwise. This might catch a lot of people by surprise. The #1 new feature I liked is the ""Tell Me"" feature. For people like myself that can never remember under what menu double spacing or some other Office command is located you just type what you're looking for in the Tell Me search box and it will automatically pull up the correct menu for you without having to search the Office help! Pretty nifty and very handy if you can't remember where things are or are just new to Office. #2 new feature that's you'll probably notice is that ""smart lookup"". Select a word in your document and a pane will open with definitions, Wiki articles, and top related searches from the web right inside the document saving you from having to switch to a web browser.

Integration with One Drive is solid and I use it daily. Integration with Box is far more awkward and rarely works, but can't blame this on MS. When that fails I use Box Sync to handle files that have to be on box. Download for office definitely takes a bit over a slower broadband connection, but if you have a slow connection I'd advise finding someplace with faster and just doing the download there.

6898.0,454,5.0,"Installing Dragon Dictate on my older MacBook (2010 4GB RAM) running Mountain Lion, went without a hitch.  I had no idea that there was an app that would connect my iPhone directly with my computer (it isn't using Bluetooth, so I assume it is using my wifi network), but it was suggested during the installation process. Genius! I was able to start my dictation training immediately, using my iPhone as the microphone, which comes so naturally!  The package includes a perfectly usable USB headset with boom microphone. With either, I quickly achieved near perfect dictation.  As I have learned over the past year using Siri, the hardest part of learning to do true text dictation, is true text dictation - period - You must think about every punctuation mark you use - comma - and remember to speak it aloud in your sentence - period. I'm told by experienced Dragon users (a colleague of mine has numerous scholarly articles and chapters to his name, as well as a second professional degree; he gives much of the credit to night shifts, and Dragon) that the pacing and punctuation begin to come naturally, especially as you watch your errors on screen.  As others have said, it is important to complete the training that Dragon provides. It is specific to this version, and has changed since Dragon Dictate 2.5. Personally, I hate instructions, but I'm having a great time learning this new technology. As I said, Siri and I have learned to get along over the past year, and I think that she has been a daily training ground for voice technology.  Some of us can't touch-type due to disability or other issues. Dragon isn't just a whiz-bang technology, it is an enabling technology that allows us to practice our professions, write and tell hilarious jokes (see above review), control our computers, email our families, or send quirky tweets.

9064.0,580,2.0,"Multitasking on a computer is a must these days making streamlining the experience all the more prevalent.  Voice commands would be the next logical step as our hands are already tied up and vocal tasking allows us to do another set of tasks.  Problem is that vocal recognition has never been a perfected science in the consumer market for everyday users and detailed command lists, or lack thereof, make marketing such products even more difficult.  Sure, word processing dictation is a handy tool for recording meetings and legal procedures but most authors, writers, and casual users prefer to type by hand given the lacking accuracy of said dictation software.  Dragon Dictate attempts to bridge this gap for Mac users and accomplishes a good amount but fails at the rudimentary basics.  In short, this product is NOT ready for wide distribution oh, too late.  For me, I needed software that allows me to multitask Safari and Final Cut Pro but know that having vocal commands for the latter is a long way off.  However, it would've been nice to have vocal software that can help navigate menus more seamlessly than using a touchpad or keyboard.  It's like the XBox Kinect or Sony Move as they require more effort to execute an action that can be exponentially easier just but touching a button making it more gimmicky than practical.  Dragon Dictate suffers from the same liability as the software has a delay, requires a mic (the internal PC mic works even worse in my opinion), and is severely limited in what it can actually do.  After doing a very annoying read-a-long calibration test that seemed more pass/fail (usually fail) as I kept having to repeat myself and, no, I do not have a speech impediment, quite the opposite.  After that process I attempted to play around with the various commands, which seemed numerous at first, but it didn't take long for me to realize that it wasn't nearly enough and they were all very basic.  If anything, there seemed to be more commands with controlling the software than my MacBook.  There were not nearly enough commands for Safari to make it worth stepping away from my Mac as I had to use both my hands and the software to navigate.  This isn't streamlining the experience as I want the option to be able to step away, grab my tea, and still be able to issue commands without having to go back to my computer to hold the software's hand.  My lacking experience with Dragon Dictate and Safari was consistent with other instances on my Mac only it got worse as the amount of commands became less and less.  After an hour of messing around I came to the conclusion that this software, while on its way to becoming a quality product, is NOT AT ALL READY and should be pulled for further testing.  For the price, this software is not worth it at all.  It's a prototype in middle-development, NOT a finished product.  I give it 2-stars because it is on its way and great for testing but that's about it.  Your average consumer will not like this, avoid until they beta-test a version that doesn't get referred to as a beta product.",1414

The excess can be derived from a combination of railroad employers or in connection with a railroad and non-railroad employer. The program does properly record the excess of the tier 1 tax on line 67 Form 1040 as a credit against income taxes. It does nothing with the tier 2 excess tax. This must claimed separately, as you noted in your email, on form 843 which is not supported by the Turbo Tax software.  The software's help does contain information regarding tier 1 and 2 railroad retirement withholding.

So far, it hasn't bitten me back and I'm slowly learning the curve of the program without being angry or annoyed.  Installation was very easy. No issues installing it to my Windows 10 PC. I also like that they made registering the product relatively fuss free. In addition to the program, when you register the product, you get additional online bonuses like 20GB of cloud storage and access to extra online content.  I've barely scratched the surface of Cyberlink's Power Director's ability. In my novice fumblings, I've played with the wizard features to help me quickly create an attractive format for my video. The program can utilize both photo and video media files to create your own movie.  When you're ready to publish, you have a choice of formats to choose from. The program also has quick settings for different device and different online services. I can upload directly to YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, Daily Motion, and others. The process went quite fast for me. Once I created my 3 minute short video in an HD format, it was rendered in a short time. The uploading to Facebook actually took longer than rendering, but it did upload properly and was available quickly.  What got me annoyed so far, when I use the Wizard help, some of the photos were cropped too tight. Even with the special effects zooming out or similar, the majority of the photos in my video were cropped much closer than needed to. Lots of good parts of my photos ended up getting cropped out. Other than than, it still managed to make a great video out of my photographs.  Once you start poking around in PowerDirector, you'll find new, cool, different, techie features that get your imagination going. You can create 3D movies, have 4K resolution, precision motion tracking, and more. It's all rather exciting.  It's a cool program. It has its quirks with the Wizard feature but still manages to create enjoyable movies to watch.",58

Corel Home Office is a fine product for its price point.

It's a fine product for small-scale business or for anyone unwilling to shell out big bucks for productivity software - not a bad choice for students on a budget.

Pluses: I found the installation to be straight-forward and reasonable in time length.  I was very impressed that Outlook imported not only our Outlook Express address book directly (didn't have to export from Express and then import), but also flawlessly imported the mail messages and the folders that were existing in Express.  This had been a major concern, and there was no problem whatsoever.  Minuses: Outlook 2007 is a resource hog. Not only does it run slowly, but other programs chug or crash.  I've had quite a few Word 2000 crashes when Outlook 2007 was closing or loading.

The software installs in a couple of minutes; it adds a NeatScan toolbar to Microsoft Office applications, from which you can control scanning. Configuration could not be simpler, and after a quick run of the calibration sheet you're ready to go. When scanning to Excel, you can use ""Neat Sheets"", templates allowing the software to know how to locate and assign information (this is geared towards filling up expense reports, but can be customized easily to perform a variety of tasks). When scanning to Word, OCR is performed automatically and results in an editable text document.  Scanning a letter-size page takes around 10 seconds. OCR processing can take about a minute on a complex page. The scanner is capable of passable color results with photographs, but it's clearly not its strongest point. The two buttons on top (Scan and PDF) trigger a scan (or scan to PDF) into the currently active Microsoft Office application (if available).  If you wish to upgrade to the full version of the NeatReceipts software, or if you're switching to a Macintosh, you can purchase the corresponding software directly from the company's web site (neatco dot com), and use it with this scanner.  This product is amazingly easy to use, and the Neat Company has quite a knack for crafting excellent software. If you need a scanner mainly for document archival and expense reports, it just can't be beat for the price. If you have lots of documents to scan, consider the more expensive NeatDesk scanner which is faster, easier to feed and supports duplex scanning.",1009
6572.0,437,3.0,"Microsoft started life as the up and coming company that dared take on IBM and won the personal micro-computing industry as its prize.  Apple existed but its computers never caught the market share enjoyed by Microsoft and its Windows family of products.  Next came the Microsoft Office Suite with its Outlook, Excel, Word and Access heavy hitters.  For a time in the computer world it looked as if Microsoft was an unstoppable Juggernaut.  But all those years of success had changed Microsoft from its former nimble self that anticipated what the market needed and was there at the ready with new innovative products before the customer even knew they wanted \ needed fresh technology.  Microsoft over time became what it once mocked, laughed at and despised in the corporate giants of mainframe computing.  Microsoft has become steeped in the same muddled self defeating institutional thinking that prevented Xerox and IBM from cashing in big time on many of the monumental computing innovations they spawned.  The Apple IPad and IPod and other products caught Microsoft napping and today Apple is bigger than Microsoft.  This brings us to Windows 8 part of Microsoft's best answer to a fast changing computing universe.  Microsoft missed the boat on pad, pod hand held and tablet computing revolution.  Microsoft still rules in the desktop computing arena but, Microsoft's desktop computer sales market share is being steadily eroded by the pads, pods, tablets and other hand held smart devices.  Windows 8 is Microsoft's software based version of a Hail Mary pass made in the computer marketplace.  Windows 8 is built around a touch screen type interface at least on the surface no pun intended. The Windows 8 touch screen interface is meant to suggest Microsoft is developing software in tune with todays Ipad, Ipod, Smart Device and tablet centric times. To win back users lost to smart phones and smart device touch screens Microsoft dumped its tried and true if dated Desktop, with its icons, mice, point \ click, task bar and Start button technology.  Windows 8 is a heavily touch screen based graphical interface that brings smart phone \ ipad like functionality to the desktop computing arena.  Mouse use is still accommodated in Windows 8 but you can see by its clumsy integration into the Windows 8 operating system that mice are tolerated like a irrelevant old auntie who has totally over stayed her welcome.  Unfortunately like many new innovations the devil is in the details of how Windows 8 was changed.  Ask yourself the questions in the next paragraph to see is Windows 8 right for you.  Is the touch screen format the very best way of interacting with your desktop interface.  Any hand held smart device benefits from a touch screen interface because; the entire device is in your hand.  A desk top monitor by compassion is huge.  Also the monitor as an output device is oriented vertical to the user which works as a display only output device but as an input device the vertical monitor is ineffective awkward and and clumsy to use.  Looking down at the interface allows easy touch screen use.  As an example imagine playing the piano if you had to reach forward to touch each of its 88 keys instead of looking down at the ""Keyboard!""  I'd dare say piano music would have a different history were this the case. You have to reach forward to interact using touch with most desktop systems.  You look down onto hand held devices which make them easier and comfortable to use. Also work in offices conforms to a different production and management paradigm compared to tasks common to smart phone and smart device touch phone user tasks.  You can't just graph a touch screen onto a desktop system and proclaim it an monumental innovation which a lesson Microsoft is in the process of learning with Windows 8.  Windows 8 is a very pretty but ill conceived interface that succeeds at being new but fails at being better, more user friendly or easy to acclimate to when moving from Windows Vista, Windows 7 or any Windows 95 themed desktop operating system interface.  Windows 8 is pretty and if you are a tried and true computer geek like me you will buy Windows 8 simply because it is there standing as a challenge to be overcome and mastered.  However does Windows 8 offer the traditional Windows 7, XP or Windows Vista desktop operating system user any advantages over a stable awesome Windows 7 is the question you must ask yourself.  If you dig under that pretty new touch screen you will find much of the same programs, utilities and goodies you have in Windows 7.  The problem with Windows 8 is not the operating system it is the many changes in how you navigate the Windows 8 computer environment.  Windows 8 is like coming home to find your whole house rearranged to the point where nothing is where you are used to finding it.  Things are placed in odd new places to accommodate the touch screen technology at the expense of point and click mouse users.  At first it appears nothing in Windows 8 is as easy to use and manage as it once was in Windows 7.  Windows 8 is change for change sake that appears forced, hurried and not at all well thought out.  Windows 8 embraces change to touch screen technology not because it was the next logical evolution in desktop operating system design and ease of use.  Windows 8 appears to be built simply to let Microsoft say me too in a world of touch screen driven smart devices that is rapidly moving away and redefining desktop computing.  In Windows 8 Microsoft is following change rather than leading it and it shows glaringly in this product.  Microsoft is a Johnny come lately to the touch screen smart device world and is being forced by the computing marketplace to do a Hail Mary Play.  Microsoft is hoping like any Hail Mary Play that Windows 8 will propel it back into its glory days where Microsoft was an engine of computing innovation envied by the world.  Windows 8 is a good solid operating system if you have the time and will to relearn almost everything you do on a desktop computer.  Otherwise Microsoft Windows 8 is a Hail Mary Pass created for the same reason Mary Mary Passes are used in football.  Microsoft could have lots of good ideas yet to come but I do not think Windows 8 is one of those better ideas.  Windows 8 is an Operating System change in order to say me too in a world computing device marketplace nothing more.

7196.0,480,3.0,"The filter set is fun to use. It offers many easy to use effects and the ability to customize those effects.  I got a review copy of the stand alone software and spent a few hours playing DFX. It's a pretty good product. It works fine on my Mac. An older version of the program was slow as molasses, but it looks like Tiffen has solved the speed problems. The number of filters offered is large. If you are looking for the same kinds of effects for your computer as you can get from apps like Instagram, you might find this very useful. Actually Tiffen DFX has a lot more available options.  This is stand alone software. That's both the good and bad news. If you don't have a version of Photoshop, Lightroom or other photo editing software, you can use just this. That's the good news. The bad news is that if you do already one one of those programs, you can't use this as a plugin. For that you need the more expensive version. Compared to a similar program, Perfect Effects from onOne software, which is $99 and works both as a stand alone program *and* as a plugin for most photo editing software, DFX3 seems pretty expensive. DFX v3 Standalone is priced as professional software, but without the ability to work as a plugin, serious photographers won't bother with it.",863

4055.0,268,4.0,"Trend Smart Surfing for Mac ------------------------------------------ Like many of the other reviewers, I have been thankful that my Mac has been virus-free... But ya never know. Just because Apple has a smaller market share, it doesn't mean that programs won't be written to zap Macs. Still. it's hard to judge the effectiveness of this software, since there aren't any malicious viruses aimed at Macs (that I know of).  The program installs easily, runs well and says that everything is okay. So far so good.  The more active aspects of this product are the parental control features, which seem pretty handy. But again, since my kid is pretty young and is only allowed near the computer in very controlled circumstances, its hard to gauge the effectiveness of this feature as well, at least in a real-world setting. I think it will come it handy, though!  All in all, this seems like a good product.

I like that you can use it on five different devices including Macs. So far I have encountered no problems and it appears to be working well.  The biggest downside is that it seems to impact performance. I have observed a definite slowness in both the laptop and desktop although other users do not agree.

Previously, the home and student product allowed installation on three PC's at a similar price point.  The products themselves work well.

11290.0,723,3.0,"Installed easily (through internet download which was required) and relatively quickly (it didn't take so long that it frustrated it me while I was left waiting for the download and install to complete) and includes the features and functionality that I would expect.  That leaves the big question of does this package offer much difference between it and previous versions of Microsoft Office?  That is a question that isn't quite as easy for an end-user like me to answer.  Sure, Microsoft will point to a bunch of improvements that were suggested by the user community and the likes of focus groups, but whether or not most users would really find something has been improved is debatable.  Worse, in some cases, the question is really whether or not things have gone completely in the other direction (such as the seeming lunacy that led Microsoft to change Office 2013 and Office 2016 to use only the color themes that there included with Office, rather than using the color themes that were set within the Operating System.  A decision that was compounded all the more by offering only a very limited and very similar group of themes in Office 2013 - something that was improved slightly in Office 2016).  Functionally, I think Office 2013 and Office 2016 are fine.  They are easy enough to use and shouldn't be that confusing for prior users (though if you are making the leap from Office 2003 or Office 2007 you'd find that there is a LOT of difference from prior versions) of the Office product suite.  If you are looking to upgrade, or need a copy for a new computer, then you should be fine with Office 2016.  3 stars from this user.",1007

3620.0,230,4.0,"Right now, there are a pleethora of options for internet security on the market. Of course there are the big hitters, Microsoft, McAfee and Norton's to name a few. With so many options out there, the normal end user can be left feeling a little shell-shocked and usure of just what to get.  If you are anything like me the first thing you do is turn the box over and look for 'the grid'. The grid tells you what is covered by that particular set-up and what is not. Usually this is just a sly way of trying to get you to buy the more expensive version that covers everything. The problem with that is, end users like myself don't always need the 'everything' option. Sometimes the simple version is better. The less options I have the less likely I am to screw something up, right?  I will spare you all the tech talk, because a) others have done it a lot better than I ever could, and b) I would probably screw it up anyway.  I have been a Norton's user for years. I had fallen into a rut of purchasingt he latest addition and just accepting the drawbacks because I didn't want to deal with the hassle switching things over. Well, this issue of Norton's has made that a lot harder. It's simplistic, intuitive, and makes sense, but more importantly it doesn't require a lot from me. So, that really means less for me to screw up.  Two things I am disapointed about.  1 - no instruction manual. Give me something, anything to read and reference when I get these pop-up messages. I want to make informed decisions. I am not always able to do that.  2 - I loathe when a company makes you pay to talk to tech suppor. The minimum call is $9.99. So, at a minimum if you call you are dropping ten bucks. Not cool. If I am a customer, they should be looking to help me get the most out of the product, not the most out of my wallet.  If you are looking for a new internet security program, or are looking to upgrade take a look at this one. Don't settle for the first thing you see. Do some research and find the product that meets what you want. There are too many options out there right now to settle for what the product offers. Make it work for you.",994

As a user searches or visits a Web site, SiteAdvisor looks in its database and returns its results as colored icons on a search page, a red button, or by blocking the site. This is good for a while, but it seems to me that its database won't know about newer sites or it may think that an old site (which was once okay) continues to be safe even if it isn't.

1595.0,115,5.0,"As a longtime Quicken user (8 years) and MicroSoft Money user (3 years) I was very disappointed when I switched to a Mac Pro last January (2009) and found no version of Money and the only available Quicken was a 2007 (pretty much unsupported and un-updated) product!  I refused to put a Windows OS on my new Mac - that would open the machine up to Windows virus attacks and other problems.  I tried ""Crossover"" which allowed me to use a Quicken for Windows program but did not require a Window OS.  That was ok but it was slow, a bit buggy, and there was no interface with ICal (so no easy alerts).  Then I found IBank!!  Not only did IBank work beautifully with my Leopard and Snow Leopard OS but it put dates and reminders into ICal with no problem.  I was very happy that it looked like a true Mac program instead of a Windows program.  Now, after 8 months of using IBank (the last version is 3.5.4) I can tell you honestly -- for my use as a home owner, on-line bill payer, watcher of credit card charges, and user of paperless monthly statements from 2 banks and 2 credit card companies -- I am VERY VERY HAPPY and please with IBank.  I highly recommend IBank!  You can use the full program for 30 days before you buy it OR you can buy it and return it for 100% money back if you do not find it to be what you need.  Amazon offers a $20 credit for people who switch to IBank from Quicken -- making the program cost $39.95 instead of $59.95!  What is not to like about that?  I have used IBank's customer service  two different times and found them to be knowledgeable, efficient, and very helpful.  They answered both questions in my first contact.  Quicken is coming out with a Mac Financial software in February- finally.  It appears to be sort of a Quicken for Mac 2010.  I will not buy it or try it!!  Why?  I resent Intuit's attitude that Mac owners don't deserve an up-to-date program for 3 years.  I don't want to support that kind of treatment to a long-time customer.  Also Intuit's new program seems to be a limited version of their Quicken for Windows programs.  I strongly suggest you check out Inuit's Q & A about the February 2010 Mac program at quicken.com.  I doubt you will want a ""fluff"" but little ""meat"" Quicken on your Mac.  IBank has had 2 updates (free to version 3 owners) within my 8 months of owning the program.  Each update came with a new complete program download and all information from my previous IBank version was transferred with no problems.  The IBank program does not allow ""direct bill pay"" like the old Quicken I was accustomed to.  However -- many banks no longer allow that service any longer either.  Both of my checking account banks (Citizens and TD Bank) do not allow direct bill pay through third party financial software any longer so I did not really suffer a loss by switching to IBank.  That may be a ""security"" protection improvement?  IBank imports Quicken data from Windows and Mac with no problems.  Set up is easy for connecting and using most bank web sites.  I used Turbo Tax for Mac (both platforms are on most versions of TTax and TaxCut CDs) last year.  I do not import information from Quicken or IBank into TTax - oI do import the personal information from previous TurboTax for Windows programs.  I cannot say anything about importing data from IBank.  I think IBank does have a lot to offer and unless you have a business or are very wealthy -- IBank should do the job for you WITH all the dependable and helpful MAC features (and connections to ICal) that you expect from your Mac.  There are some very low ratings of IBank listed in these reviews!  I do not understand why.  I know that I have not had any of the problems addressed in the poor reviews.  If you have an Intel Mac or MacBook -- I do not think there will be a problem that IBank's free customer service could not fix.  However, if there is no ""fix"" for a problem you may experience with IBank -- you lose nothing!  Just take advantage of IBank's free trial money back guarantee!!  I do not have any connection with Intuit or IBank.  I spent my time writing this review because I truly think IBank is a GREAT alternative to Quicken for any new Mac owner!!!",667

5438.0,366,4.0,"Update: 14 AUG 2012  Never much of a graphic artist, I've been scribbling on computers since my parents bought me a VTech Socrates console in 1988. Flash forward to 2011 when I needed something a little more sophisticated to draft models. As it happened AutoCAD LT 2012 came down the Vine.  Regarding this powerful but imperfect 2D drafting program, I write from the perspective of a CAD noob. Amazon Vine later offered me Corel CAD , so I've updated the comparison to go with that review.  --Package--  AutoCAD LT comes in a contemporary DVD case with the serial number and nothing else. No manual in print or PDF. All documentation is through the AutoDesk Exchange splash panel.  --Installation--  The program installs quick, goes down smooth, and fills up less than a gigabyte of storage. Take note of the software license; it includes a Not For Resale restriction that lasts three years. The expiration date is tracked in the product information window, found in the About dialogue of the Help bar. Fortunately, AutoDesk has not harassed me with re-activation notices, junk mail, or product pop ups. Unlike most programs I've experienced, it might be a good idea to read the ""deployment instructions"" online before you install.  --Operation--  From the get go the interface is more overwhelming than Corel CAD, right up there with the clutter of other prosumer applications. I also find AutoCAD's GUI mildly more obtuse than Adobe InDesign; for example, you can see the color and thickness of a selected line in the Home ribbon, but there is no similar field where one can view the coordinates, fill, or dimensions at a glance like you can in Adobe products. Some of this information can be brought up in a property menu, which can then be docked for future use. For noob drafters, sifting through controls can be slowed whenever AutoDesk uses drafting terminology, such as ""plot"" for printing. Veterans who dislike the Drafting and Annotation ribbon can consider the LT Classic command bars.  Actually using the program is tedious at first. Simply trying to select a shape and move it requires a procedure--you don't just grab it like a frame with a left-click and drag it around (dragging is possible with an extra step).  Like InDesign, taking the time to play with buttons and read the knowledge base will familiarize you more quickly than you might think. Beginners should not have to worry about hiring tutors, taking classes, or buying guides unless you are totally new to any sort of design program, in which case you should be practicing on open source programs before plunking a paycheck on this behemoth. The interface loses its cluttered feel and it becomes easy to appreciate the controls at your cursor tip.  Unlike Corel CAD, AutoCAD provides a floating context overlay that follows your mouse cursor. The line can be manipulated on the fly with your choice of a right click menu, arrow key drop down menu, or keyboard command prompting. The overlay also shows at a glance the real time dimension or coordinate as you move the cursor. Once the shape is laid down, AutoCAD provides a variety of grips and handles that allow you to change the dimensions of a shape or relocate the points of the poly line, again with a quick-glance overlay. Hover the cursor over a grip or point and see the length of all lines connected to that point. If you need more tools on the fly, a quick properties window can be toggled to appear near each object or line you select. The disadvantage is that all this feedback can overwhelm the novice user, and it can be easy to set something wrong until you learn the commands.  Returning to that example of moving an object, the procedure allows objects to be placed with a lot less nudging and fudging: using points, displacement, workspace switching, or stretching. Nevertheless, it takes time to get used to the nuances of each mode.  I also feel the right-click context menu should bring up layer and line tools. However, the aforementioned quick properties menu covers them and more.  --Output--  Your models can be saved in a variety of .DWG formats for swapping between older editions of AutoCAD, in addition to DWS (drawing standard) and DWT (Drawing Template). Also export to DGN, PDF and bitmap. Finally you can create a block file to save a particular object or set of objects to be inserted into future models. No TIFF, no SVG, no PNG or JPEG. Instead you can underlay a DWG or PDF, linking it so the current drawing file is not significantly increased. Corel CAD does not appear to have such a capability.  --Performance--  I tested the program on two 64-bit computers running Windows 7 Home Premium:  > My old HP Media Center PC with a Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 4 GBs of Kingston RAM, and a Western Digital 7200 RPM hardrive with SATA 1.0.  >My new Custom Design Rig with an Intel 2500 quad core, 8 GBs of Corsair RAM, and a Crucial M4 solid state drive running through SATA 3.0.  Out of the box, the program is buggy. Without both service packs. I experienced a number of crashes -to-desktop. Most crashes were accompanied by an error window and an opportunity to transmit a report. Even with the packs, the program can still crash if you don't wait for the Exchange panel to load on start up.  Needless to say, LT 2012 is slow to boot on the old Media Center, taking around two minutes. Once loaded, it moved decently enough, but I didn't try to draw anything with a lot of objects. The custom rig leaves flaming CAD tracks across my monitor. After several sessions, the cache of my SSD allows a load time of 5-10 seconds. Comparable to Adobe InDesign. Files also save and load immediately.  Windows 32-bit users can enable a setting in the command prompt to get 3 gigabytes of RAM. Otherwise I recommend that 32-bit users check the AutoDesk forums and the AutoCad knowledge base before buying this program.  --Support--  Autodesk Exchange allows the user to stream help videos or view HTML knowledge base, and so obviously requires an active network connection.  It allowed me to browse and install both service packs without a hitch or a long wait. However, I found the knowledge base articles would be shrunk to very small type and images when trying to print them, or to save them as PDFs with Acrobat 10. Also, it annoyed me that the Exchange did not notify me of the specific patches I needed.  --Utility--  Basically a rebranded Ares CAD, Corel's 2011 program is somewhat faster to learn and easier to use. The license is less restrictive and the help file is more accessible. Corel CAD includes 3D support as well as 2D at half the price or less of LT 2012, supporting many of the same features and file types. It also exports to a wider range of formats: including SVG, JPEG, TIFF, Corel Draw, and Corel Designer.  Otherwise, AutoCAD LT 2012 is a powerful ""prosumer"" program for drafting in 2D. The overwhelming interface is more informative than Corel CAD, and allows objects to be placed or modified with greater precision. Design and Output is relatively narrow but highly customizable. I ultimately prefer to draft in 2D with AutoCAD over Corel. High price tag, bugs in unpatched versions, and some issues with interface all contribute to knock off a star. Sheer precision and capability creates a four-star program.",607
10256.0,649,4.0,"First off, this program (or others like it) is probably responsible for most of the horrible ""art"" you see on the internet. Where people do stupid things to stupid pictures and declare it art.  So what is it good for?  Surprisingly, it is excellent for an author who needs to illustrate but does not have illustration skills.  Let me get through the basics first. The program can do MOST of what the full version of Painter can do, it is just packaged into a slightly dumbed down, slightly limited and largely simplified menu system.  But if you dig in deep, much of the full Painter program is there.  At least the functions, maybe not all of the organization tools.  Most of what you can do, you shouldn't do. It can take a good photo and make it look bad. It can take a bad photo and make it look worse. BUT, with some careful work, you can take photos and turn them into abstract or impressionist images that actually look like illustrations.  A great example can be found in Jaime Moreno's excellent video review.  He has a picture of a train track which has been turned into an excellent illustration for a book of a train coming towards the reader. This would be a decent illustration in almost any book, especially a children's book.  If you are an aspiring author and feel like you need some basic illustrations then this program could make it pretty easy for you to take pictures of what you need and quickly turn them in to acceptable illustrations for your book.  I would also add that they tools are very well done, especially things like resizing the brushes which everyone should learn from their method here! Much faster, easier and intuitive that PS and others.  Another reviewer says that teens enjoy this program. I would go further and say that my 6 and 7 year olds have a blast with it too.  So it is excellent for kids as well.  If you don't need this, then you don't need it. If you think you do, get the trial version, it is 100% enabled and you can check it out for 30 days.  But for what it does, I'm not sure there is anything out there that is leaps and bounds better. If there is, someone please direct me in the comments - I would like to check it out.  I will give an honorable mention to Autodesk SketchBook Pro 7, which is also a very good program and very stripped down and streamlined for easy of use.  I hope this has helped.",1582
3117.0,179,1.0,"I have been an avid Norton Symantec user for over 13 years.  This is the worst product EVER. It slows your system down so much that I had to disable most of the features, which an average user will not know how to do.  My biggest complaint is that once the ""virus update"" expires.. it renders the entire software useless. I couldn't even go in and make simple changes to the settings, nothing to do with the virus update feature. PLUS  A pop-up comes up everyday twice a day begging me to buy another year subscription. That is false. What they are really asking is that I buy the software again. Once a year is up .. you might as well throw it in the trash OR give it to someone else OR wipe your hard drive and install a fresh copy.  I am not happy with it at all! I will never buy any anti-virus or internet security software from this company again.  I have heard of complaints that it will crash your system the day it expires.  Uninstalling any Norton products are difficult and you should find a good article on the internet on how to do this.  NOTE: You must uninstall any anti-virus software if you are installing a different brand.",649
4149.0,275,4.0,"I've used extensively Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, and Gimp.  They all have their pluses and their minuses.  Yes, Photoshop does everything but it is also an enormous systems hog and has a huge learning curve.  It also does nothing simply and many times I LIKE taking the easiest course to get from point A to point B.  I devised a test for how well this new program does against the others.  I took the image of a lily which I had photographed.  I previously had tried to turn it to a pleasing mauve in Elements and failed miserably. I put it into this program and within about twenty minutes I had a gorgeous mauve lily ready to save.  I was frankly surprised I had done that well.  Although it has less tools on the toolbar, I discovered by using other features under the menu that I was able to do pretty much anything I wanted to do. Also, it seems that it may have made one tool to do it all rather than making three or four, like Photoshop or Elements does.  For example, the clone tool on this program seemed to do everything for me that I use clone tool and all aspects of the healing tool for in Photoshop and Elements.  However, I do miss a polygon lasso as this program only has the regular lasso. Both Photoshop and Elements have the polygon lasso. Next, I miss the burn, dodge, and smudge tools, again found in both Adobe programs. On the plus side though, there are filters with controls in this program which go beyond the ones in Photoshop and I am eager to work my way through them. For example, there is a new filter called Bloom that does a wonderful job on enhancing images.  The user interface is absolutely gorgeous, the best ever.  I like the way it looks on my macbook screen better than any other image editing program. Everything automatically disappears while I am working on the image too.  It all reappears the moment I am ready to proceed.  I love that feature! It is so intuitive. Plus the shortcuts you use in the Adobe programs are the same in this program.  I think this program has enormous potential and I especially like that it was designed solely with my OS in mind.  I am so tired of products designed primarily for Windows.  This is the first image editing product I've seen that potentially could go the distance against Adobe at least for the non graphic designer market. Only time will tell. This is also a heck of a value for the money.  Certainly Adobe would never think of selling this full featured a software for less than thirty dollars!",363
5270.0,355,4.0,"Microsoft Office 2007 was a radical departure from the previous versions of Office:  it introduced an XML-based file format that changed files like "".doc"" and "".xls""  to "".docx"" and "".xlsx"".  More importantly, it heavily modified the user interface, changing the old way of menus to the new ""Ribbon Control"" with tabs and context-sensitive icons.  This is the Professional version of Office:  it contains Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Access and Publisher.  The Home & Business Edition subtracts Publisher and Access and the Home Edition further subtracts Outlook.  Dude, Where's my Stuff? While Office 2010 isn't as radical a departure as 2007 was, it is definitely different.  Users who have just gotten used to the Ribbon Control may be exasperated to find that once again features have been moved.  Gone is the circular ""Office"" button that used to be your access point for things like saving and printing--the ""File"" menu is back...but not quite.  The User Interface has been tweaked to provide more visible work surface, and yet there are now tabs in the ribbon that completely hide the work surface.  For example, the ""File"" menu will open a web-page-style layout that covers the entire window:  it offers basic menu items on the left, some large-button categorical options in the middle, and then refreshes the huge space on the right with large buttons for the basic features.  Instead of menus and sub-menus it is now more like navigating a web site. Then there's the verbiage.  For example, ""Send...as e-mail attachment"" is now performed by choosing ""Save & Send"" on the left, then ""Send Using E-mail"" in the middle, and ""Send as Attachment"" on the right. After a little bit of time looking at the Office 2010 Ribbon and Menus, you'll start to understand exactly what's been done to Office this time around.  Microsoft have added a huge ton of features, and then tried to put all of those as close to the navigation surface as possible.  In other words, you'll no longer be clicking *deep* into the menus, you'll be making one or two clicks and then looking at all the options that are dumped on your screen to pick which one you'll be using.  To make matters more confusing, some options (such as ""Save"" or ""Open"") drop you off the File Menu, give you the typical Open/Save dialog box you are used to, and then automatically select the ""Insert"" tab and show you the work surface before you finish making your selection.  It can get very distracting.  Return of the Feature Creep In the past whenever Office bolted on new items (such as blogging), the typical way of dealing with it was to give you toolbars that you could show, hide, and drag around to arrange at the top of your screen.  Now what we have is: - Tab names at the top that come and go based on what you're doing (like Office 2007) - Changes to the workspace based on which tab you've selected - A File Menu that is no longer a candy-like button but is another tab on the ribbon...and yet it drops every possible option onto the screen and trusts you to navigate through them.  Tuned and Tweaked That said, Microsoft have done something under the covers that has been a blessing and a curse.  On the one hand, your programs will load lightning-quick.  On the other, if you try to keep two installations of Office on the same machine, what is supposed to work will instead work unevenly:  Word and Excel will let you open both versions, but my installations of Outlook and Project completely blocked my ability to launch the 2007 versions (despite repeatedly indicating otherwise during installation and configuration).  Future Forecast:  Bright, but Cloudy The other feature Office 2010 places more at the forefront is the idea of The Cloud.  In Office-Speak, this means using the Internet to keep documents synced in real-time no matter where you go.  If you remember Windows Briefcase, this is everything the Briefcase should have been.  If you ever tried the File Sync Wizard, Windows Sharing and Synchronization, or ActiveSync, this is like an invisible, hands-free version of that.  There's good and bad about this and you want to be aware of what it entails before you get involved.  For example, you can create a new file and choose ""Store on Web"" or ""Save to Web"".  When you do this, you will be prompted to choose the location.  If that location is a Windows Live account, then you'll want to pay attention to whether you are saving to a private folder or a public one.  From that point forward, any time you open the document on any machine it can fetch the latest version from the web.  If you don't want your document to sync automatically it can also be done manually.  If you're used to Microsoft Office 2007, you will be impressed with Office 2010's addition of features and its performance as a program.  Expect to be frustrated from time to time when something appears to have `moved'.  If you're new to the revised Office system of 2007 and 2010, it is a complete look-and-feel overhaul and you will want to spend some time getting to know it.",27
5477.0,368,5.0,I installed the product on a Windows 7 64 bit machine with a Blu-Ray drive.  The software worked fine with Blu-Ray movies and no problems were observed.

4366.0,286,1.0,"I had this installed for about two months straight and out of all the virus programs I've used over the years, this has to be the worst.  First of all the program kept popping up saying it had viruses.. IN THE PROGRAM FILES FROM THE INSTALL.  With both Windows 7 and Vista I was unable to correctly get the instant updates going so once I installed it, my PC wasn't able to get virus updates for two months. Oh and it never alerted me to this fact! Only upon further exploration before this review did I notice it!  ""Gamer Mode"" DOES NOT WORK on my PC with: World of Warcraft, Guild Wars, or even full-screen apps from Facebook (think farmville).  As a matter of fact I found more popups and scans running while I was trying to play a game in gamer mode than when I wasn't trying to play a game.  Again, in both Vista and Windows 7 this feature did not work.  In the end I ended up going with a free virus software download aimed at consumers, instead of this mess.  It took a long time to uninstall and I had to do some manual file-deletion.  All together this is one of the worst executed virus software packages I've seen in a long time, and I'm a very technical person and very familiar with such things!",1148

9602.0,612,5.0,"I've been using Dragon Dictate for at least four years now, and I can honestly report that with each major update the application has gotten significantly better. I'm not claiming that Dragon Dictate is 100% accurate, but if you learn how to use it properly, it will type what you clearly dictate, and it never misspells words.  My recommendations for learning how to use the program:  1. Read the manual, and also do a search for the Dragon Dictate Workbook for Mac, which includes a series of exercises that will help you learn the features of the program.  2. Practice writing dictation by keeping a daily journal for at least a month. This way, when it comes to dictating more formal and important pieces of writing, it won't be so frustrating to use the program. Practice, practice, practice.  3. Use either Dragon Dictate built-in notebook, Apple's Text Edit, or Microsoft Word for longform dictations. Dragon Dictate integrates with these programs and it allows you to both do dictation and manual typing without it getting confused. Dragon Dictate will work in other text editors, but not as well as the three mentioned above. There is also a built-in editor that you can call up in DD (say, ""open Express Editor"") to dictate text and  transfer it to another text box in a webpage or text editor. I highly recommend that before you click the transfer button, that you select and copy the text before making the transfer.  4. I find it better to dictate in phrases rather than trying to dictate entire sentences at a time. Also make use of the Recognition window so that you can see the alternative words or phrases that Dictate thinks you might be saying.  5. If you do not have experience with writing dictation, it will probably take significant time to learn the program. So it's important that you practice every day. I would say it took me almost a year for me to really get comfortable with using Dictate. I mainly use it to write journal entries, reviews like this one, and other pieces of writing in which I'm not doing research while also trying to type.  6. And finally, I would say that it helps to run Dictate on a Mac with at least 8 GB of RAM.  Dragon Dictate doesn't necessarily make you a better writer, nor does it help you get writing down faster. What it does is eliminate the need for hand typing. When you are doing dictation, you have to think about what you're going to say before you say it, and I can feel somewhat awkward, and it does take some time to formulate thoughts in your mind before speaking. So again, the main advantage of using this program is that it reduces the need for lots of typing. You will still need to read through what you dictate, and revise and edit what is typed out for you.",517
2061.0,142,4.0,"I was new to Vista when I received my new laptop, so I wasn't aware of the changing software landscape that seems to be a hallmark of Microsoft products.  Although I did get the Microsoft Office Suite, it now excludes Outlook.  This made me very, very angry.  When the opportunity to review this latest incarnation of Outlook came along, I jumped at it, because life post-Outlook is pretty awful. And, now that I'm back in the warm bosom of Microsoft's email program, I can breathe a sigh of relief.  This is the same Outlook you either love or hate.  The programs still seem to be developed independently of each other. There's also junk email scanning which is semi-useful if you don't have spam blocking on your server side. The Reading Pane is omnipresent but removable and there's this irritating tendency to group messages into, well, groups, as if the entire world thought that would be a good idea for message sorting.  News flash: It isn't. Fortunately, it can be turned off.  The calendar is the same as other Outlook calendars, only a little more graphically appealing.  You still cannot easily import data from one of the Outlook programs to the other; dragging and dropping emails preserves body and header.  Similarly, you can drag an email to your contacts, but that only drops the email name into the contacts list and dumps the entire body into Notes field.  In other words, there's no smart way to navigate content between the various sub-programs within Outlook.  This is something that's sorely needed.  The electronic signature at the bottom of emails is becoming the de facto business card, and it'd be nice if we could just import that content right into Contacts.  But alas, Outlook's not about to be THAT innovative.  The other new thing that hangs around, waiting for you to notice it, is the To-Do Bar.  As if navigating the myriad of Outlook programs who don't really like each other wasn't difficult enough, you are now expected to navigate sideways.  From a space perspective, this makes sense; there's more real estate on the horizontal axis of most monitors.  But it is counterintuitive to the rest of the Outlook design, which is top to bottom. The To-Do Bar is basically what used to happen when you clicked on your name in older versions of Outlook: it summarizes all your relevant information in one place. The problem is that it won't go away easily. It eventually goes away if you can figure out how to ask it nicely.  But apparently each application is treated like its own entity, so removing the To-Do Bar from say, email, means it still shows up when you're in Tasks.  Finally there's what's new in this version of Outlook, the Business Contact Manager.  It requires SQL server. This is most useful if you're running a business, and contains everything from projects to accounts, billable hours to marketing campaigns.  It's of particular use to freelancers and hourly consultants; as a consultant myself once, I ended up using the journal to clock my progress, but the BCM can do it better.  Being the new kid on the block, BCM is better integrated with all the other programs.  At times, Outlook's various programs seem like squabbling in-laws at a wedding...related and not happy about it.  If you can look past that - and if you're a seasoned Outlook user, chances are you're used to it - then this is definitely worth the investment.",785

3003.0,157,4.0,"I hope this review serves to clarify some of the complaints that people have posted regarding Office 2008.  Preface: After being disappointed with Leopard 10.5 -which I also reviewed- I kept using Tiger. When finally 10.5.2 arrived I began using it. It fixes many Leopard bugs. According to some websites, at least 130 bugs have been fixed. This is important since many problems with third party software may be related to other software or to the operating system. For example, Apple is aware of problems with its Sync services and Core Image. Also, some bugs have existed for many years and have not been fixed, such as a potential bug when moving data to an external device. Keeping these issues in mind I did a completely clean install of Leopard 10.5.2 in a brand new hard drive. I installed Office 2008 as well as the available upgrade to 12.0.1.  First Impressions: Some useful features have been added, such as Elements Gallery, which may be a time saver for many people. Some features have been removed, such as VBA, and this may be a deal-breaker for many people. I'm keeping Office 2004 in a separate partition in order to use previous versions of Word and Excel. At the same time, I can still use the new versions when I don't need the VBA features. Lack of VBA support was announced well over a year ago, so this came as no surprise.  Starting up: Each program took approximately 10 seconds to launch. Office seems to have a peculiar way of handling fonts, though, and launch times can be greatly effected. After installing another program that installed more fonts, and installing Extensis Fusion to manage my fonts, launch times for Office programs was approximately 150 (one hundred and fifty) seconds, instead of the original 10 (ten) seconds. Now it takes about a minute to launch these programs. In all fairness, the slow down is partly caused by third party software.  Overall (and very brief)  impressions: PowerPoint works with presentations that used to crash my 2004 version. The 2004 version was practically unusable for me. This was a welcome upgrade.  Excel works fine and the Elements Gallery is a good addition. It lost VBA support and the Abalysys Toolpack. I kept the 2004 version as well.  Word seems to be a solid upgrade. Some third party templates do not work with 2008, so I kept Word 2004.  Entourage works very well. I had to re-select the folders that I had set up for my rules, and re-apply categories to my folders. Syncing with Address Book always adds many duplicate contacts. Fortunately there are scripts to deal with this inconvenience. Hyperlinks still require a workaround, as mentioned by another reviewer. I would not rate Office with 1-star solely based on that issue.  Expression Media used to be called iView MediaPro, iView Multimedia, and iView many years ago. It used to be a $25 shareware program when I first used it. Eventually it became quite expensive so I never upgraded until I received this version. So far I'm happy with it. It has worked fine for cataloging thousands of fonts and pictures, and I'm entitled to a free upgrade when version 2 comes out.  Price: There are free Office alternatives, as well as iWork. I( still prefer Microsoft Office for the most part. The only exception may be Keynote 4. Microsoft offered a substantial discount under the names of The Technology Guarantee Program and the Super Suite Deal. Additionally, for one day they offered a $[...] rebate. So users could get the Mac Special Media Edition for approximately $[...]-$[...] with these offers. Had it not been for the offer, I would have stayed with Office 2004. I've used Office 2008 for a few days, every day, and so far have encountered no problems.  Overall I'm satisfied with the upgrade. Support has been great, both by Microsoft and the MVP people. Search their forums and you'll find a lot of useful advise.",543

Obviously this software has experienced these same issues since FTM 2008 (5 YEARS) on XP, Vista, & Win 7.

Their ""fix"" included disabling security software, updating Windows, updating net.framework 4, re-installing MSE 3.0, updating printer drives, and manually re-installing FTM 2012.  Each suggestion appeared reasonable excepting the manual uninstall which include the use of RegEdit to  manually delete several keys in the registry - a dangerous proposition for the average PC user!

Want a hobby solving for why (your) computer(s) aren't functioning as expected - get Windows.  Want to instead spend your time 'using' your expensive piece of technology... get a Mac.  PCs are cheaper b/c there is a 'free-market' on the components - meaning there are lots of different components and thus problems with them working together nicely.  It's your time and you have to ask yourself - ""what's it worth to me."" I'd rather not loose the 10's of hours thank-you and instead use that time for something else.  Windows 7, my report to you, from me, a guy who owns PCs and uses them heavily in graphic design and high-end commercial production.  Sincerely.  Windows 7 is: *slow - example, right click on a desktop item and you'll be waiting several seconds before the menu appears - enough time for you to give up and repeatedly right-click - causing more issues (FYI I use high-end PCs with super fast SSD drives with 8 processors or more, with 16GB RAM or more, on a 64bit OS - and it's still slow)  *buggy - example, Windows 7 still ships with a blatant bug that causes the clock to not tell the correct time... a year after it's release, Windows 7 still is known to ship with this issue - your computer can't tell time correctly.  *stupid and poorly designed - MS tried very hard to copy the designs pioneered by Apple.  The user interface is XP blended with OSX.  Sadly, Microsoft didn't improve on that design; and actually did a rather poor job of copying it.  There are parts of Windows 7 that clearly still XP where you have windows that can't resize to reveal all of their data/messages/paths so you're forced to ""scroll"" or in some cases you simply don't get the ability at all (example: properties page for a folder - ""location"" only displays the first 50 or so characters - the window doesn't resize).  Areas of XP which needed improvement - take for example the XPs infamous ""screen saver"" - have actually been changed and made less-user friendly (the Windows 7 screen saver removes the ability to set the rate to an exact value - like every 3 seconds - at which pictures will rotate - instead it's ""slow"" ""medium"" or ""fast"" and no clue as to what those equal).  I could go on, but I have PC problems and OS issues I'm trying to solve right now - understand?

1707.0,125,5.0,"First encountered Microsoft's Windows OneCare in 2005 as a Beta project that I participated in. Wouldn't have gotten involved except that I had found Symantec's Norton AntiVirus to have become a real resource hog, and the products from McAfee weren't any better, despite their claims. I had been a loyal user of Norton AntiVirus since those days that Peter Norton was still running his innovative company, one that pioneered anti-virus applications as we know them... but that was then, and this was now.  I dropped the Norton products after a series of problems that were well-documented in the 'computer geek' community, and began to install Grisoft's AVG Free anti-virus on some of my systems. About a year later Microsoft released it's Beta test of Windows OneCare, and that seemed to be a product with few bugs and a lot of promise. When the Beta test was over, however, I standardized my computers with AVG Anti-Virus Free Edition, and that continued until late last spring when I saw an associate's installation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Windows-Live-OneCare-2-0/dp/B000V6YPAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Windows Live OneCare 2.0</a>&nbsp;and listened to his reasons as to why why he had switched from Symantec's products.  Initially I downloaded the trial version from Microsoft to test it out, but within two weeks had become convinced that this was not only a competitively priced product (other products have only recently caught up), but it's resource footprint was small. It didn't seem to interfere with normal operations or offer obnoxious reminders of how my computer was being protected.  Windows Live OneCare runs quietly in the background, doing its job well and quite unobtrusively. It's licensed to be used with up to three users, and right now is protecting my aging&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HP-Pavilion-a210n-Desktop-PC/dp/B0000A277A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HP Pavilion a210n Desktop PC</a>, my son's laptop computer and my notebook.

All of its updates run quietly via Microsoft Update, and this has kept my systems up-to-date with the important security updates.  Pros:  * Very reasonable cost for what it does. * Runs quietly and effectively in the background. * Excellent monthly reports on activity. * Has an excellent two-way firewall. * Automated backups to external hard drive or USB storage devices  Cons:  * OneCare interface is different, may seem somewhat awkward. * Other anti-virus and firewall programs need to be removed.  This product isn't perfect; no security application that I've encountered to date is. The occasional reboots for updates are irritating, but all applications of this type have them to work properly. The Windows Live OneCare interface is different, and may seem somewhat awkward until you get used to it, but it does function properly. Had laughed last spring when I read that OneCare had mistaken Skype (the Internet telephone application) for a piece of malware, but have see similar false reading from almost all of the anti-virus and security applications on the market over time.  The above remarks may sound picky, but they're really not; they're just a personal reflection of what I've found while I've used this product. But all things considered, and especially since it's so well-behaved as it runs quietly in the background, doing its job quite unobtrusively, Windows Live OneCare is a real 5-star application from my perspective.  Please note: I'll be posting helpful info about this product and possible updates in the Comment section below this review, so be sure to check there as well.",46

5330.0,359,4.0,"You probably know somebody that everybody in the family calls to fix their computers when they slow down or have problems.  Yeah, I'm that guy.  Now that I've (finally) discovered Norton 360, I'll be spending less time with the relatives once they buy copies.  I've used Norton Internet Security for years and have recommended it often, particularly in recent years when Symantec made it run faster and leaner.  I never went for Norton 360 before receiving a review copy because frankly I couldn't really understand what it was from a quick glance.  Norton 360 does everything Norton Internet Security (NIS) does, and more, but with a different interface.  It includes firewall and antivirus protection as well as Identify Safe, identical to NIS.  (Your NIS settings and Identity Safe vault all migrate if you switch to 360 from NIS.)  Identify Safe is primarily a password manager, saving and entering your passwords for you under the protection of a single master password so that you are more likely to use appropriate, complex and site specific passwords for the web sites that you visit.  360 includes features in two areas beyond NIS:  Backup and PC Tuneup.  The PC Tuneup portion is where I jump for joy for its ability to save me from spending time cleaning up computers for friends and relatives.  It automatically does the things that I do manually to their machines, including:  1. Removal of Windows temporary files (no more searching %temp%, %tmp% and all of the other places that these things hide)  2. Removal of Internet Explorer temporary files  3. Startup Manager - controlling the many hidden programs that launch when you start your computer.  Way easier than running MSConfig, the Norton 360 Startup Manager lets you mark non-essential startup items as ""delayed"" - so that your computer starts up in a jiffy, and then these things are launched somewhat later (reported to be 5 minutes) by 360 itself.  For example, there is a Microsoft Office and Adobe Reader item in most people's startup group.  These allow Office applications and Reader to launch faster when you need them, but at the cost of slowing down the time before you get control of your mouse when you start your computer.  With 360, you get your desktop sooner - and these things can still get launched, just a little bit later.  (Or you can disable them - which has no affect on the functionality of Office or Reader - just makes them launch slower.) Etc.  4.  Registry Cleanup - the Windows Registry is a single, huge database that all software on your computer stores settings in.  The bigger and more cluttered it gets, the slower the computer runs.  360 can find entries for software that has been uninstalled and did not clean up after itself and tidy things up.  5.  Internet Explorer history cleanup - nothing special, other than it can be scheduled to run at times you choose  6.  Disk Optimization - defragmentation is essential to fast disk performance on Windows machines.  The defragger that comes with Windows itself is fine, but must be run manually.  The Norton 360 one can be scheduled to run automatically, eliminating the issue on most computers of the user either not knowing how to defrag, or continuously forgetting to do it.  All of these tune-up activities can be set on a schedule to keep things running smoothly.  Finally, 360 adds a Backup service that can backup via the internet to the ""cloud"", or to local media. This is useful and adds to the completeness of the product, but the user interface is so poor, that I take one star away in this review.  Symantec gives you 2 GB of online storage with your Norton 360 registration.  You can purchase more, but at a hefty charge relative to competitors.  You can access this storage through a Norton product or the n360.backup.com web site;  you would have to upgrade your license annually to maintain this 'cloud' backup.  But, the backup service can run automatically, incrementally uploads only files that have changed, and knows where they came from if you need to restore a file right back to its original location.  This is an excellent option for off-site backup of really important files that would make your life miserable if the disappeared in a  fire or explosion.  But, of course, it is slow to transfer large files.  Note:  your files backed up to online storage are only as secure as your Norton account login password - hackers could try to access your files via the web interface which is accessed purely with your Norton account login credentials.  And, the web interface can be outrageously slow.  It just took the site 30 seconds just to display my My Documents folder which contains a single (test) file.  On the plus side, the web interface to your online storage has a search function so that you can quickly find the file you're looking for.  You can also backup to thumb drive, optical media, a hard disk, or a network location (mapped to a drive letter).  The negative about the backup system is that  you do not have a normal Explorer-like browser tree to select or exclude the files to be backed up.  Instead you have a horrendously ugly long scrolling list of full path names to files - no enclosing folder, nothing, to make it easy to browse and find files that you want to exclude/include.  There is not one person who I help with their computer troubles who would have a slight clue as to what these long file path names mean relative to their data.  I just don't know what Symantec was thinking of, putting this in a program otherwise designed for everyday Windows users rather than tech geeks.  It is not just this list, but the whole backup process which would confuse my less techie friends and relatives - they need a wizard to lead them through the process.  One last thing I like about 360 - which is at version 5.1.0.29 as I write this (an automatic update) - is that in the Activities and Scans window, there is a checkbox to shut down the computer when activities are complete.  So, there's no excuse not to save energy when you leave the computer for the night - let 360 download updates, do backups and Tune-up activities, and then shut your computer down when it is finished.",494

1195.0,81,5.0,"Did my homework on these network-through-your-household-wiring things, and was skeptical.  Found reviews of the Corinex HomeNet Powerline HD200 adapters, found lots of either one-star or five-star ratings, and lots of sob stories about how poor the installation instructions were, and what a terrible ordeal it was to get them installed and working properly.  I needed what they offer, though, so I ordered a pair and braced myself for a terrible experience.  I have to say that the ""2 Minute Installation"" note on the front of the package turned out to be a significant understatement.  It took me at least five minutes to get the adapters cabled, plugged into wall outlets, and synced.  I did exactly what the instructions said to do - six easy steps - and everything worked perfectly.  I didn't have to touch any of our network settings.

Doing taxes is a tiresome and tedious task,  never easy, but TurboTax is the best help available. It walks you through every possible situation and has in depth explaining for cases where needed. It will print the entire return for sending electronically, or mailing and especially for your records to keep. It saves your returns from year to year saving much time. This version, Home and Business, is my choice because it also handles 1099s which are especially difficult to do ""by hand"". A simpler TurboTax version is just as valuable especially if you have a ""plain vanilla"" return. Most of the TurboTax editions, and there are about a half dozen choices, include one state return.

The 2014 edition is hitting the spot though.  This is the best accounting software I've tried. Whether you run a small business or something very tiny out of your home, Sage is worth it.  Pros: -Easy to set up, use, and learn. Obviously learning comes easier if you have an accounting or reporting background. -Runs smoothly and without error after a few weeks of use. -Sage has upgraded! Lots of features and the interface looks good. -The software helps you determine which tools are most beneficial for your needs. -Good for forecasting and managing inventory.",1520
7691.0,511,5.0,"Having to comb through multiple records and screens, and even different programs to get up to date when a customer calls is cumbersome in the older versions. I would often let the answering machine take the call and then I would return it once I was able to bring up the customers history including emails. Now it is all integrated into QuickBooks; smart move Intuit.  Of course they are in to it to make money. (No pun intended) so payroll now includes paying only 1 employee instead of 3 like it used to. It is now $2 per employee, per month for each additional employee. However that is a lot cheaper than a payroll service.  For those who are angry at Intuit for the challenges of setting up the installation, all I can say is what else is there? Hey I get frustrated like the next guy but I have been using Intuit products since their inception. (I am an old late 80s DOS guy to start) They have always been way ahead of the curve in making easy to use intuitive products; hence the name Intuit. I was frustrated with Qbooks 2013 in the colors they chose to display. It was hard on the eyes, next to 2010, but then they corrected that pretty much with an update.  I love QuickBooks. I have been running my company with 2010 QB Pro and there isn't anything I don't love about it. I could get critical and say when I am sending a customer an email it locks me out of being able to go anywhere else other than that window. That is one of the advantages of 2014 thanks to its greatly enhanced email functions.  QB 2014 also sports a calendar with reminders. I often use my tasks option in Outlook for running my business. So doing this in QuickBooks will seem like second nature to me.  QuickBooks in years past kept me so organized that when I got into a dispute with a business associate over some numbers he was blown away at how easily I could provide reports that substantiated everything I was saying. Consequently I got paid for what we agreed I would be paid for.  One important tip is that if you are running more than one business you may want to keep your old version as well. Be sure and back up your company files before loading a new version. When loading any new version of QuickBooks it asks you if you would like to keep the old version, or overwrite it. I keep the old version AND I choose not to have my company file updated to the new version. That way I can keep two versions of QuickBooks open at the same time. It is tedious to have to close one company, and open another every time a customer has a question. So by having two versions running concurrently, you can click on either tab and have instant access. You also can have one version running on one machine, and another version running on another if you have more than one person in the office, and each one assigned to a different company. It saves money that way not having to pay for two new versions when the old one works fine.",7

4108.0,272,3.0,"TREND makes an average security software lineup priced accordingly. I have not problems with this software. It does pretty much as advertised. If you want to get away from all the hype with the big name products like McAfee and Norton then this is a potential option.  It is setup to run basic/minimal security out of the box. I'm sure TREND doesn't want to overwhelm the average Windows user and increase their likely hood of getting more tech phone calls. I prefer a more robust setting with better protection. You can go in a change the settings to a more advanced setup, but this is not easy for the average user.  It was easy to install and removes any old security programs you may have on your computer that may cause a conflict with it. Modern security programs need to have complete control and don't like sharing resources with other competing programs.  I like that is comes on a usb key. CD's are so last decade now. With more and more people with broadband internet they tend to just junk up your office or get scratched. This is also nice for netbook and users without a cd/dvd drive.  Running the program did cause a few of the built-in windows security features to conflict. Windows firewall flagged up a warning as TREND's firewall was being setup. The firewall was also set to minimal protection as default. This provides virtually no protection. Make sure to change this.  Windows XP users shouldn't have many problems with this program. Be careful if your running the new Windows 7 as many people have reported that this does not run well on it.",511
3347.0,215,2.0,"I had very high hopes for this software, as I wanted to take advantage of it for real estate purposes.  Since I am also new to the product, I was also curious about the interface, in that I didn't have any expectations based on previous versions, unlike others that have posted here.  Suffice it to say that any hopes I had were destroyed almost instantly.  This is one of the worst user interfaces I've seen in quite a while, certainly in a major product from a major publisher (and I'm a software development exec).  Virtually everything is non-standard and few things work as expected: clicks and double clicks, right/left button functionality, drag & drop, highlighting & selecting, map navigation, context menus, zooming, export & import, etc.  The iconography is just awful, awful - reminiscent of the software of a decade or more ago.  I also found the functionality outside of routing and route planning (both of which are excellent) to be more restrictive than hoped, with particular disappointment in the territory functionality, territory definitions being too limited for my uses.  Finally, the map graphics themselves just don't make the grade.  While readable, they don't display any real quality until quite closely zoomed, looking quite sketchy to that point.  The high point of the software is the routing functionality, as mentioned above.  It is powerful, flexible, and has many options I have not seen elsewhere, and which are far beyond anything available in Google Maps, Mapquest, or other web-based mapping software.  If this is your primary interest or need, this software is for you, even with the issues mentioned above.  Still, had I to break it down, I'd give MapPoint 2009 5 stars for routing, 4 for Microsoft software integration (Outlook, Excel, Access, etc.), and 1 for everything else.  Couple that with its rather steep price and I really can't give it more than 2 stars overall.  Very disappointing.",674

The introductory tutorials are useful though a little superficial and as others have mentioned the anonymous data collection that's impossible to opt out from is annoying and unnecessary for a business product.  Targeted at small businesses, it may work well for some with uncomplicated operations since it has elements of Freshbooks and Quickbooks blended together, though for the price I'm sure many would prefer the cheaper cloud solutions offered by both. For my use, I enjoyed testing out Sage but will probably stick with our existing Quickbooks accounting system due to ease of use and a simpler user interface.",1373

10994.0,703,5.0,"I've used quickbooks before, and some open source accounting software, and found this easier to install, but it is a very comprehensive package.  It comes with several sample companies that you can study or use to base your own company's files on.  There are also video tutorials to get you started.  I found them helpful.  More training is provided at a cost, but for basic accounting I can't see a need for it. It seems a bit more powerful than perhaps what we need, but this certainly will scale up for sizable companies with much more complicated finances. I like that it doesn't take a super powerful computer to run.  Mine is running on a desktop that's a 2 or 3 years old and wasn't top of the line by any means when new.  I installed Sage 50 when the desktop was running Windows 8, and it upgraded and runs fine on Windows 10. Overall it seems a bit more complicated and a bit more powerful than quickbooks, though I don't find it hard to use, a lot will depend on one's level of comfort and experience with software in general.  It runs quite smoothly and doesn't slow my system down, and I like that a lot.  The software doesn't become useless after a year like some programs do, but support and updates do stop. You can use this software to send price estimates, create sales orders, send bills/sales invoices, and enter receipts of money, as well as keep track of inventory and costs. The software can be expanded, at additional cost, to cover doing payroll or taking credit and debit card payments.  Downside- It seems like overkill for a very small business.  However, if a small business were to grow rapidly, it should scale up very well along with the business.",1079

It does what it says it will do but really I don't need much of what it offers me because some open source projects I've used handle a lot of this for me already. I could see some value in someone less technical using the software though (although the open source projects today have pretty decent GUIs for the most part).

This software makes the job easy and dramatically reduces the time versus writing from scratch.  The time saved and professionalism in using this software even once will justify the investment.  After all, one does not write a business plan without intending to invest money in startup costs.  Another advantage is the completeness of a work product from Business Plan Pro 15th edition.  It's doubtful one would independently design a business plan that covers as much ground without this software.  I had always thought writing business plans was tedious and therefore many people simply have it in their heads.

3641.0,232,2.0,"Back in the early days of CD mastering software, Adaptec Easy CD Creator (now Roxio) was the only real player in town.  Then came Nero, which was light, swift, and powerful.  For those in the know, Nero was the choice application for CD mastering, and later for DVDs.  When I upgraded to Windows 7, I had a few applications that were no longer supported.  Nero 6.x and PowerDVD 5.x were two that I missed most.  When I saw a tremendous deal for Nero 9 Reloaded (free after rebate), I jumped at the chance to use Nero again.  I was excited to see the changes and improvements from 4 major updates (9 and 9 Reloaded are counted as 1 update each).  Despite all the negative reviews, I thought surely it couldn't be that bad.  Right?  PROS: - Familiar interface - Good burning performance - Many multimedia features & tools  CONS: - Excruciatingly slow install - Slow startup speeds for every app - Too many below average apps - Shameful forced install of Ask.com toolbar - Updates are not integrated or easy - Very poor value - Many apps outperformed by free or open source apps  For the sake of reviewing Nero 9 Reloaded, I chose to install all the applications in the suite.  This amounted to 2.98GB of space required.  I knew I'd uninstall most of the applications but wanted to be thorough.  Nero Burning ROM is 324MB by itself.  At the end of my evaluation, I nearly had to uninstall everything.  INSTALLATION At the very beginning, I was asked if I wanted to install the Ask.com toolbar and make it my default search engine.  I elected not to install it.  After choosing all the applications to install, I was prompted to install the required 3rd party software, which I was ok with, except that it FORCED me to install the Ask.com toolbar!  What.  The.  Heck???  I timed the actual installation time to be about 22 minutes, during which the installation screen displayed ads for Nero's other applications.  If I were staring at the installation screen for 22 minutes, I think I would have found tips on using Nero 9 to be more useful than watching the same 3 or 4 ads cycle over and over again.  This was a bad start.  After the install completed, I ran the Nero Control Center, which allows you to manage all the apps in the suite including checking for updates.  All it does for updates is open your browser to Nero's web page and you have to see for yourself if the version numbers match or if there is an upgrade available.  The version on the disc I bought was 9.4.17 and version 9.4.26 was available so I downloaded it.  All 204MB worth.  After numerous failed download attempts and even the failure to run once and re-downloading it, I waited an additional 15 minutes for the update to install.  The update forced another couple of 3rd party apps to be installed before completing.  All told, I spent over an hour getting Nero 9 ready to go.  NERO BURNING ROM Nero Burning ROM was 90% of the reason why I chose to even try Nero 9.  Well, aside from being certified for Windows 7, it is essentially the same as Nero 6.  Even the GUI is remarkably similar.  On the plus side, because I was so familiar with Nero 6, I was able to find everything quickly and get running right away.  Unfortunately, the interface was never a highlight of Nero 6 so it retains the unintuitive characteristics.  NERO SHOWTIME Showtime is the media player included in the suite and accounted for about 5% of the reason why I wanted to try Nero 9.  Since my old PowerDVD didn't run on Windows 7, I figured Showtime would be a reasonable upgrade from just using Windows Media Player.  While it does offer more options and useful tools, I found that the audio was unacceptable.  Watching Star Trek (2009) on it was a far more enjoyable experience on WMP than Showtime.  The audio was just bland and not very crisp.  What is wrong with this thing?  I tried messing with the audio configuration but nothing really helped.  Bummer.  NERO VISION Nero Vision allows one to take a video file, from say a Flip camcorder, and burn it to a physical DVD for playback on a standard component DVD player.  Other than adding a few fancy 3D menu templates, it is virtually unchanged from Nero 6.  This was the last 5% of why I wanted to try Nero 9.  REMAINING APPLICATIONS The rest of the suite is sorely below average.  I would use Audacity over the audio editing tools included in Nero 9 and Picasa or Paint. NET over the photo tools.  I don't have a TV tuner on my PC so I could not review the Nero Live tuner/DVR application but I'd guess more of the same.  The tools like DiscSpeed, DriveSpeed, and InfoTool are ok, but again, you can find free applications that do the same things.  I also did not review the RescueAgent and did not install the free backup software, BackitUp & Burn.  SUMMARY I thought I would end up writing a review proving all the negative reviewers wrong.  Instead, I am saddened by the mighty fall from grace that Nero has taken.  Nero 9 is the very definition of bloated.  Load times and performance on nearly every application in the suite was painfully slow.  And the only application really worth having, Burning ROM, has changed very little from FOUR versions ago.  Nero sells just the Burning ROM application for Linux at a reasonable cost and wish they would do that also for Windows because the rest of the suite has watered down the value of Nero.  Even then, they would have a hard time competing against a very good free Windows application called CDBurnerXP, which I recommend for those who only need something for data & audio burning and ISO capabilities.  It takes up less than 11MB of hard disk space and installs in less than 30 seconds.  Oh Nero.  Your time is up.",1000

8672.0,555,4.0,"I've been using Turbo Tax for the last 5 years for my federal and state filings.  I have always used the web version except for this year that I decided to purchase the downloadable desktop version.  The reason for the switch was simply because  I wanted to take advantage of a discount offer that was not available for the web or any other version.  Transferring last years' return should have been more straightforward.  I was expecting a transparent transfer of last's years data, since it comes from the same company (intuit), regardless of where the data was stored, but it required me to start filing the 2013 form on the web, then loading 2012's data into the 2013 form, exporting the 2013 data into a file and finally importing this file manually into the desktop application version. I was able to figure this out, but only after searching through the intuit web site, and following a user-posted workaround procedure, not intuit's.  I probably understand the security and technical reasons behind this, but I can also see the headache's for less technically-inclined users going through the same situation.  I took one star out for the reasons mentioned above.  In the end, the actual filing process was smoother than with the web version.  The software responded more quickly to my inputs and clicks, and I didn't hesitate going back to make adjustments or corrections to the different forms.  With the web version you can get confused when navigating the application; sometimes the browser's back button is not the correct option to go back to a previous section and it gets a little stressful.  I had an overall positive experience with this product and recommend it for new users.  Just make sure that this is the correct version for you.",378

I use this far less often than WordPerfect but it to is intuitive which is important  for someone like me who does not use it often. I have had to put together basic spread sheets and Quattro Pro is easy to use.  This also comes with Presentations a slideshow creator which I have not used.

3617.0,230,5.0,"This version of McAfee offers a whole bundle of features, including some cool stuff that isn't on previous versions.  Installation is fast and easy, even though you have to remove your existing anti-virus software, and it doesn't cause application errors or slow down system performance.  The single CD in the package can provide protection for up to three computers for one year, after which you need to shell out for the annual fee at the going rate. Installation also offers the option of installing from the CD provided and then updating from the web after installation is completed or downloading the application from the web and then installing.  It has a simple, user friendly appearance and a choice of two interfaces -basic and advanced.  It should be noted that some of the options are only available to persons logged in as ""administrators"" and not to the other users on your computer with limited permissions.  If you're the only user you can consider yourself promoted to Administrative level.  ""So what does it DO?"" enquiring minds want to know. Well, here goes.  1.  It provides a firewall as your computer's first line of defense against identity theft, viruses, spyware, spam, hackers and other bad things that go ""bump"" in cyberspace.  There's a ""lockdown"" feature that stops all internet access with one click.  2.  It makes web-surfing safer by rating your search results, as well as the sites you visit, using a color code.  Green = safe; Yellow = caution; Red = get the heck out of there NOW.  (Works with Google, Yahoo! And MSN searches.)  3.  Automatic updates and upgrades  4.  Stops viruses in their tracks, as well as worms, Trojans and other slimy things, and then automatically cleans or quarantines the little boogers.  The QuickScan feature patrols the vulnerable areas of your computer to check for threats.  5.  Offers you a ""stealth mode"" that blocks incoming network connections so you can lurk on the internet without being detected by hackers.  6.  Blocks spyware, adware, and other bad ""wares"" from stealing your log-ins and passwords, tracking your cookies, or filling your screen with pop-ups.  7.  Keeps your computer uncluttered with a QuickClean system that takes out the trash, such as temporary files, cached files, lost file fragments, deleted e-mail messages and other undesirable junk.  8.  It includes a ""Shredder"" for permanently deleting top secret documents such as love letters or romantic poems penned under the influence.  To make it even cooler, there are three different shredding levels.  9.  Automatically recognizes spam, phish and scams, fake virus messages and all that weird foreign language stuff, and stops it from filling your in-box  10.  Provides different levels of blocking depending on the age or maturity level of your child.  It has easy to understand settings like ""young child"", ""child"", ""younger teen"", ""older teen"" or ""adult"".  Age appropriate searching makes sure that the safety filters of some popular search engines are enabled. It uses keyword filtering and even blocks offensive images.  11.  Provides an automatic back-up feature which requires the installation of Microsoft.net Framework 1.1  12.  Tactfully defers certain updates and alerts while you're watching movies or playing games in full-screen mode to prevent interruptions.  Recommended for PCs and small networks, families with internet-savvy kids and people who like to go into sites marked with 3 X's.  Amanda Richards, October 15, 2008",688

3323.0,211,3.0,"I've used two different handheld GPS units (TomTom and Garmin) and I've used two earlier versions of Microsoft Streets and Trips several years ago. I edit a consumer technology website so I feel very comfortable reviewing this product. Unfortunately, I can't give Microsoft Streets and Trips more than a lukewarm recommendation.  Let's start with the installation of the the software. The installer program on the included DVD-ROM is easily confused by other startup applications ... so don't try to install this software until all of your Windows startup applications (antivirus, wireless assistants, etc.) have finished loading. Even a single background application can throw off the installation.  Once installed, the trip planning software works fine, but you can do the same thing faster, easier, and for free using Google Maps or Yahoo Maps online. The overall Streets and Trips software interface isn't very intuitive so expect to stumble around trying to figure out how it works the first few times you try to use it.  Once you're able to get the GPS receiver to lock onto satellites and provide directions, things don't get much better. The spoken turn-by-turn directions aren't always clear, and because of the weak GPS receiver (more on that later) you don't always get the verbal directions when you need them.  The included GPS receiver/USB dongle is large but doesn't provide very good reception. I live in Cincinnati, Ohio (a reasonably large US city) and half the time I cannot get the GPS receiver to lock onto a satellite. My Garmin nuvi 360 handheld GPS gets better satellite reception, is easier to use, and the spoken directions are easier to understand. The only major advantage to The Microsoft Streets and Trips software/GPS receiver combo is that you can install it on a laptop so you don't have to carry a laptop and a GPS when traveling ... you can just use your laptop. Of course, that's assuming the GPS receiver actually gets a signal and can provide turn-by-turn directions.  The software supposedly gets updates for traffic conditions, but it never seems to know when there's a major construction zone ahead ... even if it's a construction zone that has been there for several months. By comparison, my Garmin GPS almost always knows when I'm about to approach a construction zone and alerts me in advance.  Bottom line, I really can't recommend Microsoft Streets and Trips 2009 with GPS to anyone unless you can't afford a stand-alone GPS device or smartphone with built-in GPS. Yes, I suppose it's nice to be able to navigate using just your laptop in the car, but the weak GPS receiver sort of kills that benefit.",928

Two minutes + on a fairly modern Quad core system running Win7.  I just couldn't take it any more.  Now frankly if you are a pro, that initial setup is nothing.

However, it's a solid, affordable program, and I've gotten good use out of it.  I really like the title and subtitle functions and effects (it practically constitutes a program on its own!) and the special effects are definitely something to be considered.  To put my review in perspective, I use this program with an at-home green screen and manipulated photo stills to create a ""moving comic"" style of work (classic comic in some cases, anime in others, real image/animation mishmash, and mine and my husband's personal art styles), and it absolutely excels at this. In conjunction with Corel's PaintShop Pro, I can't ask for anything better in this price range--and can't ask for hugely better anywhere else.  For my needs, it's great. I can't comment on feature-film capabilities (not quite there yet) but I'd imagine, if you know how to work it, it'll yield similarly solid results, assuming you aren't planning on creating the next ""Avatar.""  My biggest complaint is that it's not exactly intuitive. It isn't impossible to figure out by any means, and compared to certain programs, it's an absolute cakewalk.

1351.0,87,5.0,"Despite the negative reviews, I took a chance on upgrading from 2006.  I'm glad I did.  In fact, I can't remember ever having regretted purchasing a newer Quicken product.  There are a few features for 2007 that are notable:  The graphics have been completely revised and updated.  For some people the charts and colors may not be that big of a deal, but for me I benefit from seeing my finances in picture form.  This change alone would have been worth the price.  The online update feature has been streamlined and improved.  In 2006 the online update of accounts was a little cumbersome, especially if more than one bank was used.  With 2007, multiple banks are processed easily.  The check register has more features for making entries.  The tabs are easier to read and offer more options for each transaction.  Reports and other screens within Quicken when minimized are easier to restore.  In previous version of Quicken once a window was minimized, it was difficult to find it.  In this version, each minimized window displays as a tab at the bottom of the screen.  Switching between windows is a breeze.  While other people may believe large, sweeping changes are only worth the price of an upgrade, I prefer having smaller, incremental changes.

12135.0,774,5.0,"The 2010 version of MS Office is much more stream lined than Office 2007 and far less clunky than Office 2003.  I upgraded to Office 2007 when it came out.  It took awhile to get used to the new style.  As many others have mentioned, the menus are completely different than the menus of Office 2003 and prior.  In fact, Microsoft calls them ""ribbons"" instead of menus now since almost everything you need is in toolbars at the top of the page instead of the old drop-down menus of yore.  This takes some getting used to.  I feel completely comfortable with computers and it still took me a couple weeks of heavy use before I really started feeling comfortable.  Going from Office 2007 to 2010 isn't a huge jump.  The 2010 version is just more stream lined than 2007.  The menus feel more intuitive.  I don't feel like I have to seek out basic functions, like I did with 2007.  Even though 2010 is easier to use than 2007, I don't recommend paying to upgrade.  It's just not worth it.  If you're still using Office 2003, it's definitely worth upgrading to 2010.  My workplace still uses Office 2003 and difference between the programs is huge.  I find myself getting frustrated with 2003 when I know 2010 does things much more smoothly.  I also prefer MS Office to Open Office (a free productivity suite).  I'm not a huge Microsoft fan, but again, Office 2010 makes Open Office feel slow and clunky.  I recommend Office 2010.

When you want to revisit a section some of them make you walk through many pages to get to where you want but I still give it 4 stars because it's not that big a deal and you can just jump directly to the form. I would maybe give it FIVE stars if it could handle a NOL (Net Operating Loss) or at least point us to the IRS Forms we need to fill out manually but it's almost impossible for it to actually do it completely on the first year you have a NOL because you have to carry it back two years and then file amended returns for those years and then use what's left  and carry it forward. But it could at least explain that in the program. My CPA friend wanted 300.00 just to do that one Form 1045 and he wanted 1500.00 do do my return so it's all relative and a matter of what you are capable of and what you are willing to tackle.  I did my Federal return this year in about two hours and it was complicated but it took another hour to do the state because, for the state it was the first year I could apply the NOL to it and I had to fill out a state form outside the program and you have to know where to apply those numbers by reading that forms instructions but I don't know if they are even mentioned in the interview because I skipped a lot of it and had to figure out for myself what the state (of California) was asking for. It's so far of it you leave out one step that you know you did it wrong as it adds rather than subtracts the numbers throwing it off by a HUGE number.  Be aware that Sch C has not changed but the screen used to enter the expenses has changed a lot from what it was in 2013 Deluxe version.  One thing that pushed it up to 4 stars from maybe 3.5 is that the support is much faster this year, or at lest it is this early in the year.

While it does really well at nixing cookies (which is true for this as well), it sometimes doesn't do so well at other viruses, though. In our experiences, we have had good results by scanning, defragmenting the drive, and then scanning again. Repetition of this pattern for some time got rid of one pernicious virus that we had, but I have caught something on my computer that this product hasn't caught, yet.  As far as this particular program, we have been running it for about a week and a half. So far, it seems to perform about as does the more mainstream version. There are a wealth of more complex options, all of which seem to be designed to, essentially, protect you from yourself. If you are careless enough to need these, odds are good that you didn't bother to turn them on. Basic virus protection is good, and this product will probably suit most people's needs. Unless you visit a lot of warez sites and spend too much time downloading torrents, you probably won't get a virus that this can't handle. And, if you do, computers have a half life of something like a year and a half before replacement, so you probably shouldn't worry too much about that.  A major plus was the install. We installed this on a netbook that has no digital media reader (i.e., no CD/DVD ROM drive.) By using the website, we bypassed this need. The key on the CD worked with the online download, which was both nice and surprising.  Overall, its a good program. It does what it is supposed to do.

Also, I loved being able to assign stars to each photo.  That helps me quickly find my favorites instead of hunting through thousands of photos.  That was where my happiness with this product ended, though.  I got it so that I could edit some home videos that had been shot at the wrong speed, hoping I could correct the speed in this package.  That didn't happen.  I found the page in the PDF manual explaining how to change the speed, but there were no images showing me how to get to the menu or button I had to click on to access the speed adjustment.  I could not find it on the timeline, which is where it is supposed to be located.  Then I tried playing the training DVD, which would not play.  I went back through the startup slide show, and this did not help either.  My project is dead in the water.  I wanted this mainly for editing videos and I can't figure out how to do it.  I gave this 3 stars because I think if I could view the DVD, I would like it better, and it is laid out well on the screen for editing.  It's not intuitive, though.  You probably have to have the manual and a working DVD to figure it out, and frankly that makes it too complex for me.  I just don't have time to make learning this my life's work.  I'll try a different package.  Update: I figured out how to slow down my video in Windows Live Moviemaker, which came free on my laptop.  Only took me 5 minutes.

12067.0,771,4.0,"I have been using some form of Microsoft office since I have been in Middle School.  While I really enjoyed what it had to offer at first, at some point it started to get annoying, mainly because Microsoft would assume you want something some way when you really don't.  It then turned into constantly undoing what Microsoft assumed that I wanted.  A perfect example is numbered lists; I would type a number, then Microsoft in their infinite wisdom would assume I wanted to create a numbered list and simply pressing the return key would automatically enter the next number.  Sometimes I wanted it like this and sometimes I didn't, but when I didn't it became frustrating to constantly undo things.  Another thing I absolutely hate is the automatic double spacing when working with Word.  Sure there is a way to turn it off, but when I need to type up a quick document I don't always remember to do so.  I have heard all the great things about Word Perfect, but since the cost wasn't worth it for me to pay to not deal with the annoyances of Microsoft.  However given the opportunity to try this out without any cost to me, I jumped on the chance.  First off unlike Word, Word Perfect does NOT assume anything other than auto capitalizing when you type ""i"".  Other than that, no automatic lists, no automatic double spacing.  It simply gets out of the way and lets you work.  There is no need to worry about having to stop in the middle of typing to undo something you didn't want done.  That alone is just about enough for me to abandon MS Office altogether.  In terms of the other software in this suite, it works just like Excel (Quatrro), and PowerPoint (Presentations).  It also comes with other software, but I don't think I will be using them at all.  The main applications I will be using are the Word Perfect and Presentations.  In addition this software suite can open all Microsoft files including those the the ""x"" on the end of the extension.  So it doesn't matter if I have a doc or a docx file, this suite can open them.  One thing to keep in mind about Quattro; while it opens xls, and xlsx files, the way to enter formulas it a bit different from the way you enter them in excel.  Instead of an ""="" to reference cells or to enter a formula, you use the ""@"" sign instead.  It shouldn't be too hard to figure out because this change is automatically taken care of when you open the Microsoft files.  I really like using this Word Perfect Suite, but after using Office for over 20 years, it will take some time for me to get used to the new interface and layout, but one thing is for certain, I certainly enjoy not having to waste my time undoing things Microsoft automatically does when I'm just trying to type a document.",376

3434.0,220,4.0,"The Rosetta Stone (RS) learning interface is well designed and very clean. It is the most user friendly language learning program I've experienced.  What's more, the user interface applies to all of their language modules so learners of multiple RS language modules will be comfortable and at home with the ""dynamic immersion"" approach.  At best, the RS Mandarin will train you to be conversational in Mandarin. It will not allow you to recognize and write Chinese characters easily- that is an entirely different discipline better served by other instructional approaches. It is possible to speak and not be able to read the characters at this stage.  Mandarin is hard language to speak for most westerners. The 4 primary pronunciation tones (see Wiki's Pinyin article for an excellent overview) sound subtle to western tongues and are very hard to pronounce for the typical English speaker. This is because the way the mouth (lips, tongue, breathing) moves in pronouncing Mandarin is completely different to speaking English. My wife, an American from the South who speaks English with a somewhat relaxed and dragged out accent, has incredible difficulty in discerning the tonal differences, let alone pronouncing them accurately. Discerning and learning these tonal differences is crucial to successful conversational Mandarin. If you remember the 70's-80's Kung-Fu movies, they sometimes have a Westerner as a sparring combatant and they will sometimes speak some Mandarin in between the flying punches. To the Mandarin speaker, it always sounds really funny because they have typically messed up the tonal inflections. For example, ""ma"" can mean mother, horse, to scold, to wipe, a question, measles, etc., when used with the correct tone and context. So, to avoid speaking ""Kung-Fu Mandarin"" (comical and embarrassing in a business meeting, but at least it gets them smiling), it is essential to listen to the Mandarin speakers on the RS software very very carefully and practice repeatedly. That said, the speakers on the RS software have clear excellent accents but the microphone pronunciation feedback tool is not tight enough and will tolerate tonal mis-pronunciations.  If you are learning Mandarin alone, it would be very helpful to still seek a native Mandarin speaker. It helps to observe the mouth when pronouncing the words (I wish RS would have avi's of the speaker's mouth up close as a pronouncing aid). It also helps to be corrected immediately to avoid entrenching bad habits. And if you are finding an instructor, get an educated person that speaks with a proper accent. You want the Beijing news reader quality. China is a large country and speakers from different parts of China have very different accents. For example, speakers from HK or Canton will often speak (if they even can!) Mandarin that is heavily tinged with a Cantonese accent.  No point learning that. Should you be discouraged? No!!! If you are in China or get Chinese cable programs, you will notice some westerners on the language and outreach programs. Folks, these guys speak a brand of Mandarin with such accuracy and poise that would put most native speakers to shame!",940

5182.0,350,5.0,"I've long promoted AVG's free products to friends who asked my opinions. I've tried them myself, and they provide an acceptable level of service- great news, considering the price. However, after a terrible experience with a well-known security product several years ago (see my other reviews for details), I swore off all security programs, deciding instead to be vigilant with my machines and my internet activities as a better way to protect my machines. Recently, though, I've tried several new products, and haven't had any major issues with any of them (though there have been some minor frustrations- see below). AVG Internet Security 2011 is the best I've seen, though, by far.  After test-driving Norton 360 on my 'junk' machine, and being frustrated with the way it tends to make decisions FOR the user, instead of giving the user options on how to handle potential threats, I was hoping to find a product that would be equally vigilant in detecting potential issues without taking the machine over. AVG Internet Security 2011 does just that. As you may know, some programs register 'false-positives' with security software- they are safe programs, but they exhibit some characteristics that trigger suspicion. That's fine- if my security software thinks there may be a threat, I want to know about it. However, some security software (like Norton) take the initiative of deleting or quarantining automatically, and this can be very frustrating. AVG engages the user at every juncture, presenting options to clean, delete, or make exemptions for such software. This is very helpful.  More generally, AVG runs silently, it doesn't use up a lot of resources, and its notification system is great- notices are displayed as corner pop-ups that don't distract, but are easy to review if desired. I never really had any issues before I got AVG, and haven't had any since, but it's great to know I'm protected without having to sacrifice performance or worry about the program doing something I don't want it to without my knowledge.  In brief, AVG Internet Security 2011 is a sound investment, and the fact that customer service is available makes it a worthwhile upgrade from the free versions.

My previous experience was that the the software was fine but that intuit was annoying in that they never lost an opportunity to market to me or install unwanted crap on my computer.  Well, my new experience is that they did manage to miss a few annoyance opportunities but have addressed those problems.  I wish they had paid as much attention to shipping a better product.  Seriously, this version is slower than the one I used in 1996 and that was on a computer from that era - about 250 times slower and smaller than my current one.  The new quicken doesn't download account data any better or faster in spite of the broadband versus the old modem connection.  It's still doing the slow agonizing one account after another thing too.  The user interface feels positively sluggish.  Note, this is on a brand new laptop that is otherwise fine.  Having run software organizations, my suspicion is that quicken is a legacy product that no one at Intuit is comfortable programing anymore.  They do their best to adapt to new versions of windows, but that appears to be about all.  Other than that, they bandage what they must to keep this cash cow a-milking.  They probably don't even have a product engineering team in place anymore.  Nothin' there but marketing folks and a product manager pairing up phone support contracts with the cheapest possible suppliers.  They will however, find new and innovative ways to market to us.

10988.0,702,4.0,"Over a decade ago, I tried starting a business. It was a mess and, ultimately, a failure. Among the miscues, I thought I would set up QuickBooks and act like a real business owner. I never got very far with QuickBooks. It had too steep of a learning curve and I did not have the time to experiment with it. Years later, I took a brief introductory seminar about it and reasonably concluded that it was more difficult than useful for me.  Sage 50 Pro Accounting is, to me, much more intuitive. It has a handy setup guide that helps set up common business models. My current business is property management so I used the setup guide for that model. It added many reports and forms and provided step-by-step assistance to complete the essential information. I would prefer to remove some of the many entries that are not applicable but can see why they would want to include everything even remotely connected.  Maintaining records in a real accounting software system is much more involved than, for example, using a spreadsheet or database system, but I never feel completely lost with Sage 50.

The vault now is supposed to be the repository of the ID and Password collection, similar to what I now use with KEEPASS. Breaches of the cloud storage areas are now more common, but to shut off an option that was convenient to me, and was, I felt, more secure on a local device or drive, is not the best idea.

6665.0,439,1.0,"*** Update 9/30/2013 ***  I am reducing my rating from four stars to one. This is because this program not only does not work as well as the  2005 version but it also failed to migrate reports from the older version to the new version.  I have installed this version on a Windows XP and Windows 7 partition. In both systems for the program works the same: Even though I have set it up to memorized transactions, this version absolutely refuses to do so. After going through a lengthy troubleshooting with Quicken tech support we determined it was not a corrupted data file. They recommended I uninstall Quicken and download and run a program that will clean out all traces of the installation (supposedly).  After doing the above and reinstalling Quicken 2013 the same problem exists. It took me a while to notice this as many of my routine transactions were previously memorized and those memorized transactions still automatically popped up. As of this date there seems to be no solution. To put it bluntly this version is a dog.  *** Original Review *** I've been a Quicken user since version 2 for DOS way back in 1988. While I don't use many of the advanced features, I do rely on it to keep my finances in order. Over the years Intuit has had a nasty habit of messing with an interface that worked pretty well. They also tweak the file format just enough so that the data from the new version is not backward compatible, so you can't go back, even if you don't like the new product. My latest version was Quicken 2005 and I was happy with it, but since it was offered this on Vine, I decided to give the latest version a try.  Before beginning the installation I did a backup of my Quicken 2005 data. After the backup was completed I begin the installation.  After accepting the license agreement informs me that it will uninstall my previous version and migrate my data the new one. After the installation is complete it wants me to reboot. This I do.  After rebooting I start Quicken 2013 and register the product. After completing the registration it converts my Quicken 2005 data to Quicken 2013 format, but only after backing up my Quicken 2005 data to a separate folder. Nice touch.  Quicken 2013 puts two icons on your desktop, one for the program and one inviting you to check your credit score. I think the second is really lame. Still, there's a lot less advertising than in previous versions of Quicken.  As with any Quicken installation it automatically installs sound files for many operations. I immediately went to the control panel and eliminated most of them. Besides these minor gripes the installation went smoothly.  Most, but not all, of your settings from the previous version are maintained, so you still have to go into the preferences to check.  Once the program opens the first thing you notice is the drab interface. Still gives you a choice of four color schemes but all are equally drab. The shading in the register is so light it's virtually indistinguishable from the white.  Tab Bar Across the top of the register are several tabs. You can choose which tabs to show or hide, but the process is clunky, as you must go into the ""View"" menu for each item you want to change rather than just presenting you a list that you can choose from and letting you click all the ones you want. At least you can choose ""Classic Menus"" and uncheck ""Show Tabs."" There is also a tab bar at the bottom of the screen that you cannot make go away.  The new interface is generally nice and the program is stable for me both on XP and Windows 7.  Bottom Line I find Quicken essential to managing my finances, but for my modest needs Quicken 2005 worked well. Had I not gotten the program through Vine I would not spent the money on this version. Now having evaluated the program I do not feel there is sufficient added value to justify upgrading. IMO, if you have a previous version of Quicken that works well for you I see no reason to upgrade to Quicken 2013, especially since there does not seem to be an upgrade price for users of previous versions. If you are just starting out with Quicken, I would suggest Quicken Basic or even Quicken Checkbook.",938
946.0,64,5.0,"It has been said that the biggest cause of stress and anxiety is caused from a perceived disconnection from the Divine--either within oneself or in the universe at large.  We are finally realizing that our thoughts, emotions and physical body have an etheric counterpart that registers our bodily states. Attending to our spirits promotes peace, health, and a sense of well-being. The effect of stress and anxiety on our bodies is well documented. Likewise, studies are showing the powerful effects of prayer, meditation, and joy on our emotional and physical health.  Kurt Smith and Corwin Bell of The Wild Divine Project are two visionaries who have developed a groundbreaking tool that engages mind, body and spirit. The Journey To Wild Divine - The Passage is an ""Inner-active"" computer journey that integrates the power of the spiritual quest with an innovative biofeedback interface and high-end multi-media production. It incorporates mythology and elements of the classic hero and heroine's journey with state of the art 3D graphics, video and music.  In developing The Journey, Bell and Smith have collaborated with various leaders in the field of consciousness and compassionate action on both the spiritual and biofeedback technology aspects of the project. Known as ""allies,"" they include Jean Houston, a pioneer researcher in human capacities, and Nawang Khechog, a former Buddhist monk and one of Tibet's foremost world music composers and musicians.  Bio-feedback is the science of recording both Skin Conductance Levels (SCL) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV), and using this information to modify thoughts, emotions, and breathing. SCL is the measurement of sweat gland activity on a person's skin, and HRV is the calculation of the differences in heart rate from one heartbeat to the next. No two of these intervals are exactly the same, and you need a device more sophisticated than just taking your pulse to determine it. Those who exhibit greater HRV tend to live longer and enjoy life more. When playing this amazing adventure, you slip 3 fingers in the comfortable sensors known as ""Magic Rings"". Your SCL and HRV are interpted by the ""Light Stone"" energy translator.  Up until now, biofeedback technology was in the hands of experts--where a professional had to interpret your results. From those results, you would then learn how to regulate breathing, thoughts, emotional states, and so on. However, with The Journey, the game itself lets you know how you're doing.  Set in the magical Sun Realm, players encounter breathtaking scenery, helpful mentors, and various ""Events"". For example, you're invited to join Cosmo and Sophia in the Inner Imagery Theater--which includes inviting your own partner to share the Magic Rings. Cosmo and Sophia show you how to challenge one other with sensory imaginings, and then you and a partner explore images from the five senses.  For example, my husband and I entered the Inner Imagery Theater together where we challenged each other with images such as ""I want you to imagine stroking the soft fur of a kitten"" or ""I want you to imagine the sound of a gentle rain falling on a tin roof."" All of the other Events I've experienced thus far, however, have been for just one person. (But I'm nowhere near completing the adventure!)  In one of my journeys, I entered a lush courtyard with vibrant greenery, colorful flowers, and majestic colums. I was encouraged to relax and levitate a purple ball. Sound easy? Not necessarily! It depends on how able you are to enter into relaxing breath and peacefulness. There are times when I can float the ball off the screen, but yesterday, I couldn't get it past an inch or so. I was irritated by my son's interruptions (which sent the ball back to the ground!), but it occurred to me that this was a perfect scenario to increase awareness of my thoughts, breathing, and emotional response. After I played the game for about an hour, I was amazed at the marked difference in my mental and emotional states.  However, not all ""Events"" are designed to promote calm. With some, you have to think joyful, enthusiastic thoughts and increase the rate of your breathing--such as spinning a pinwheel.  Helpful mentors you'll encounter include The Royal Falconer, Kwan-Yin--Lady of Compassion, Mila-Rugom, and Luna the White Wolf. You'll receive a magic bag created by the Lady Of The Woods, where you'll be able to store items that you collect on your journey--and use for other Events. For example, you'll need to pick a red rose from the courtyard to give as an offering to the Durga. You can save several areas to the bookmark section, in case you want to go back. Sophia guides you when you first start a game, but when you load it another time, you can bypass this introduction and just head right into the gameplay.  The Journey to the Wild Divine - The Passage comes in an attractive, sturdy box which includes:  *CD-Rom Software featuring spectacular high-definition 3-D graphics and video  *More than 40 unique energy and breathing ""Events""  *Install disks for both PC and Macintosh  *Easy-to-use ""Magic Ring"" biofeedback sensors  *""Light Stone"" energy translator  *Supports upcoming multi-user, online experiences  *Original Soul Flight music CD  *Companion Guide and User's Manual  The music that accompanies the game is filled with gorgeous orchestration from the Soul Flight CD, performed by The Wild Divine Band. Featuring Kurt Smith and Andy McEwen, the band's music (which is sold separately, as well) is intended to have Transformational Effects that can help facilitate the journey of the soul.  The Journey to Wild Divine is a groundbreaking tool for stress-relief, mindfulness, and meditation--promoting a sense of well-being and health. I highly recommend this visionary gift to humanity.

6258.0,416,4.0,"CyberLink PowerDirector 10 is a video production application that can be used to assemble all manner of video projects. Normally when I think of CyberLink I think of DVD playback software so PowerDirector was not a product with which I was previously aware. I have worked with other video production software, namely Pinnacle Studio and especially Corel VideoStudio, so I was interested in comparing PowerDirector to these products. While PowerDirector is not perfect it is a good software package.  Installation of the application from the DVD was quite painless. The installer asked me a few simple questions and shortly thereafter I was off and running. The install didn't take long and ran into no glitches. Once finished, I launched the application and was ready to start working.  First things first - unlike other video editing applications I have used, PowerDirector runs as a native 64-bit application on my system, not a 32-bit application in compatibility mode. For some this won't matter, but what this really means is that it should run faster as it has the full 64-bit address space. While it is very likely that other applications will be available as 64-bit applications in the near future, PowerDirector is already there.  The similarity of the graphical interface between PowerDirector and other applications of the same type is striking, at least in terms of color scheme and basic layout. All of the applications I have tried (with the notable exception of a single shareware application) have a slate gray color scheme with dark backgrounds, gloomy gray palettes and neutral colors for the menu systems. I am not sure why this has been adopted as a standard. Also, all have a review window in the upper right of the client window, a media palette in the upper left and center and a timeline-style editor on the bottom where you can drag and drop media files and text to compose the video.  Once past the basic layout of the GUI, PowerDirector goes its own way. The basic interface is very clean and uncluttered and the timeline is divided into logical track groupings to make editing straightforward and easy. By the smart use of tab controls everything is very well organized.  CyberLink has included a very generous set of transition effects as well as media files. What really startled me most in this regard is the inclusion of sound clips from which you can build a soundtrack to your video production, all without needing ti import more music files or audio clips. Clicking and dragging to the timeline is all that is required to put together a complete video production.  I decided to use PowerDirector to put together a stop-motion video with a series of still pictures. I have over 500 pictures in the series and the purpose behind all of these pictures was to tell a story and to create a video from them. I was able to import the images, select them all, drop them on the timeline and play them back without any trouble, but I did run into a small disappointment in the settings in the process of putting this together.. Rather than set the image duration on all 500+ images, I instead went into the application settings and changed the default. The installed default was 5 seconds, and I had in mind to change it to 0.1 second, but the application only allowed me to set it to 0.2 and gave me no indicator at all that the setting was invalid.  Another disappointment was that I found absolutely nothing in the documentation or the help file to tell me what I needed to do in order to create stop-motion videos. I finally resorted to an online search which took me where I needed to go.  I have a webcam on my computer and in playing with the interface I ended up in the Capture area. PowerDirector immediately found my webcam, turned it on and I found myself looking at my own face on the screen. This was a startling but good surprise - PowerDirector had no issues with setting up my webcam for capture.  Creating a video from a completed timeline is simple and straightforward. It provides output for AVI, MPEG, MOV, WMV, FLV and more. Of the applications of this type that I have used, PowerDirector has the widest variety of available formats. And, yes, it's fast.  I have not played with the 3D effects or the disc creation. I have explored a little, though, and it looks like creating a DVD is a straightforward task. I will try this later.  Many reviewers have complained about stability issues with PowerDirector and I have just not seen any issues so far. The application has been fast, stable and easy to work with. That does not invalidate their claims though - there are enough people that have stability issues that it leaves one to wonder what I am doing differently (what what I am NOT doing). From my personal experience, though, I have not had a moment's trouble with PowerDirector.  There is no question that PowerDirector is a powerful application for creating videos. It is easy to use and it is fast. For me it has been stable. It is not perfect, but I am satisfied with it and based on my own experiences with it I can recommend it to anyone wanting to create video content.",478
963.0,66,4.0,"The twelfth of the Nancy Drew Mystery Series. Things are graded A-F, just like school.  The Crime: C  It's 1930, and Nancy stops by the home of Emily Crandall to check on her. The girl has recently lost her mother, and now has said she is seeing things. She asks Nancy to put her mother's jewels in a safe, but before Nancy can do so, an explosion occurrs! The jewelry is stolen and Nancy Drew begins her first case.  Also on the docket is finding out what happened to Josiah Crowley, a local eccentric who had promised to leave money to Emily. The Depression is starting and the young girl can use all the help she can get!  Suspects include Emily's guardian Jane W., kind banker Mr. Archer, and ""psychic"" Richard Topham (who also happens to be Josiah's sole heir).  My thought on this was that the crime was trying too hard. It left me feeling indifferent.  Puzzles: B  The look and feel of the puzzles was great. My favorite one was the number/symbol game in the carriage house. I agonized over it, but I loved it. Ultimately, though, there didn't seem to be a lot of puzzles in this game at all. Not as many as previous games.  Gameplay: B  This game is more a fetch-and-carry than a mystery. The mystery tends to get lost while Nancy spends most of her time running errands for people around town. Everybody has a line like, ""Oh, I would love to do that for you, Nancy, but first I have to..."" and of course Nancy volunteers. This happens over and over. Even Nancy comments to Bess, ""You wouldn't believe what I had to go through...""  You drive Nancy's roadster, which I liked, deliver telegrams for extra money (which I liked, but got tedious after a while), explore hidden passages, fish the local waterhole, and play mini-golf.  One thing I didn't like was that the mini-golf was disconnected from the game. In CUR, Jane's games had to be won at some point in order to get something. In CLK, the mini-golf is obviously there only an extra.  HI did a good time integrating the time period and the Great Depression into the game without hitting us over the head with it. I really liked how you could experience the town and the townspeople, even though you could only actually enter a few locations (they used black-and-white period pictures to show you the rest).  There are no spooky moments, no suspense, and no thrills and chills here at all. The closest you come is when Nancy scares herself in the hidden passage.  This is the shortest Nancy Drew game ever made, with the exception of SCK. I finished in 7 hours, and that is unlike me. I was disappointed; I expect more bang for my $20.  Time Changes: None. This all takes place in a single day.  Voice Acting: B  The voices all kind of rolled off me. They were wonderfully done, but they were missing some ""oomph."" Emily seems sad and delicate, Jane is blowsy, Richard is a slick public speaker-type, and Mr. Archer is a nice guy.  Carson Drew was excellent and is the reason for the ""B"". He's perfect: wise, patient, kind, loving. Nancy's relationship with him is spelled out in the first phone call - they love each other, and he thinks she's a smart cookie. Perfect.  The people who stood out to me were the bit players - Mrs. Jakowski, good-time-girl and local phone operator, and Mrs. O'Shea, patroness of the orphanage.  Music: B  Period, and very nice, but again, I was sort of indifferent. I did find myself nodding my head to the jazzy ragtime that plays in The Lilac Inn's entrance hall.  Graphics/Video: A  The best yet, of course. One gripe I do have is why are all the slim girls so frightening? Jane in CUR and Emily in this game are scarily thin. If you look at Emily's feet as she sits in the window seat, you can tell that the size of her legs and feet is so small as to be almost impossible. Why can't HI do a skinny girl without her being out of proportion?  Technical: A  Perfectly perfect.  Overall, I think this one is neat and entertaining, a great way to pass a few hours, but it was lacking The Wow Factor for me. I just wasn't dazzled by what I saw like I have been in the past.  If you love Nancy Drew, this one's for you. Play it and have a good time. Don't be surprised if it falls a little short, though.",424

9104.0,582,3.0,"Anyone who's been following the software market knows that Adobe shot itself in the foot with its new rent-to-not-own software pricing scheme. And anyone who's evaluated this Corel suite knows that Corel has set out to eat Adobe's lunch. Not only does the software take in Adobe files, CorelDraw offers a ""workspace"" that emulates the look and feel of Illustrator, and Photopaint offers a similar workspace for Photoshop, as well as some recently added path-friendly capabilities. Searching for Adobe on the Corel site turns up much advice on how to handle the transition.  So, how well does the Corel suite really handle Adobe files?  * ILLUSTRATOR TO CorelDRAW *  I prepared a file in Illustrator (CS5) with two art boards, two main layers, and eight sub-layers (some were created on the fly as I added text). Into this project I placed a daring spline-defined squiggle, some gradient-filled shapes, and text in both Arial italic (which both programs offer), and Accent SF, which is only available in Adobe programs. I saved the file as an Illustrator file (.ai).  Upon first opening the file in CorelDraw, I was informed that Accent SF was unavailable, and offered the option of replacing all instances with another font (one was suggested), either this one time, or in general. All text remained editable, as did the shapes and the squiggle, including re-splining. All good. (The Corel site offers more complete information about what kinds of effects are brought forward, and what isn't).  While the content translation was good, however, the workspace translation was not. The art boards were transformed into pages, which in Corel are tabbed, not side-by-side, and the main layers were retained, but not the sublayers. Most people won't care. Wizard-level Illustrator users will be frustrated. (Using the Adobe-style workspace doesn't really help, though ""page sorter view"" will show you all your pages).  * PHOTOSHOP TO PHOTOPAINT *  To test the Photoshop/Photopaint transition, I prepared an eight-layer drawing in Photoshop from my CS5 package, in 32-bit RGB (Corel offers 24 and 48 bit), including one weird spline-based curve, and using some hard-to-replicate glows and shading, and some text again in Arial and Accent SF.  I rasterized and smudged some of the text in one layer just to be ornery, and stretched the text in another. Then I saved the file in native (.psd) Photoshop mode.  Opening the file in Photopaint, I was delighted to see a very accurate rendering of the original, somewhat brighter, and now in 48-bit (one of the choices for color here is ""Adobe RGB."" Bravo). Corel's ""What the font"" feature even managed to identify the Accent SF font, with a little help from an online database. Editing the text was another story. Maybe because Photopaint opened the file as the background? Corel's Help file counseled me to use ""Import"" instead. Ok. Nope. I still got only one Photopaint ""object"" (what Photoshop calls a ""layer,"" according to Photopaint Help, though there isn't really a 1:1 correlation here). Using the magic wand mask tool let me (tediously) separate the graphics into separate layers/objects, but (maddeningly) left some drop shadows behind, and the text was still unrecognized. Yet, the Photopaint help file says that Adobe text is imported as a text object, and therefore editable? Well, I did visually alter some of the text, and Corel doesn't like that. Maybe if I saved each text layer as its own file? I give up.  * OTHER TRANSLATIONS *  Just for grins, I opened the Photoshop file in CorelDraw, which produced an error message suggesting I use ""Import"" instead. Kudos to Corel. Importing, however, produced the same problems (no separate layers/objects, so no ability to select or edit text), as well as some awful distortions. Opening the Illustrator file in Paintshop Pro (X5) gave me a nice rendering, and I could then use the magic wand tool to salvage the graphics, though the text was a lost cause. Unfortunately, Paintshop Pro isn't part of this package. (Further online research indicates the best option may in fact be Corel Painter, which I unfortunately don't own).  * CONCLUSION *  Overall, I think this Corel suite will be useful for general users who don't want to (repeatedly) shell out absurd amounts of money for Adobe software. Real high-end graphic artists who want to continue to be able to access their own work, done in Adobe, are between a rock and a hard place. Adobe is in the process of alienating the entire industry, and Corel doesn't quite cut it (yet...).",1302

4731.0,317,1.0,"Quicken has abandoned the users of the Mac platform, so the users of the Mac platform should abandon Quicken.  Like most other people reviewing the product, I became accustomed to Quicken for Windows, and then sought a similar financial software title after switching to the Mac.  Despite the ""Quicken"" logo on the box, this is NOT a solution for my needs.  If you're going to spend this much money on financial software, it's safe to assume you need it to do more than provide you with a running total and colorful icons - you need it to track each transaction, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS, have robust budgeting features and flexible account / category creation / interaction.  Quicken Essentials for Mac does not fit the bill.

The software is no longer available from Amazon, but can be downloaded directly from the developer.  It's written in Java, so it's completely cross-platform (running exactly the same way on Mac, Windows, or if you swing that way, Linux).  It has almost all of the features of Quicken, with the exception of tight integration with TurboTax- you can download new transactions for all accounts with one button, it securely stores account passwords, it can track most every type of investment transaction (notable absences include not-yet-vested stock and option grants), it can print checks, and you can design as many budgets and reports as you need.  Plus, it's extensible, so you can download extensions that will allow you to export tax-relevant transactions to the TXF format (used by TurboTax), or perform a number of other useful features.  Finally, Moneydance absolutely CRUSHES Quicken when it comes to data freedom - it stores all your data in XML format, and can easily export data should you ever want to move back to Quicken (you know, if you're a masochist) or to any other financial title.  Anyone who's ever tried to extract a decade's worth of data from Quicken will be sure to appreciate this feature, and recognize the confidence the developer must have in his software if he doesn't feel compelled to trap you into using it (a la Intuit).  Since Intuit can't be bothered to write good financial software for the Mac, support developers that can.  Get Moneydance, and you won't regret it.",577

I love Photoshop but tend to spend a lot of time with it, so the supposed time-saving features of Lightroom would be helpful.  I really hoped this product would make it easy for me to use Lightroom. Unfortunately I had trouble staying alert through more than 3 or 4 lessons at a time, and that much only covers a small portion of the material.  I don't think this is because of the presenters so much as it is the difficulty of covering this sort of material in a video format.  The Introduction alone consists of 26 videos. It seemed like a commercial for Lightroom rather than a tutorial. Seven of the lessons are devoted to ""What's New"" -- not too relevant for beginners. On the plus side, there were plenty of screen shots to familiarize us with the look of the software.  Unit 2 has 11 video lessons on importing pictures.

911.0,60,3.0,"This is my 12th review and completed adventure in the Nancy Drew series.  First, I'd like to start by dividing my review into two factions. 1) The game itself 2) My personal detective work.  * PART 1 *  PLOT: Nancy is asked to involve herself in her first International mystery! This lady detective heads on over to a 14th century English manor  reputed to hold a startling family history of intrigue, chaos, and scandal! Also, in recent events, a full-fledged curse involving a dangerous beast marauding the moors!  But to get down to business, she seeks why her neighbors' daughter is suffering from a strange case of [lycanthropy?}  INITIAL SCORE: 93  CHARACTERS:  Linda Penvellyn : I love a mysterious woman, but this is ridiculous! I really don't get the anger issues now that the plot reveal indicates the TRUE source of her ailments.  Was this just a woman who cannot handle stress or does she have other deep-seeded issues? I still have no idea what she looks like and I am not buying the game cover art because she was not involved in any real part of the storyline.  Jane Penvellyn : I really loved playing those games with her and I spanked her more times than not.  I sensed a little attitude with her at the end. I didn't know how to take that...  Mrs. Drake: I thought I would see more of her than I did especially since she was a main presence in the day-to-day events of the manor.  Then again, I never really enjoyed talking to her so I guess it was for the best.  Nigel Mookerjee:  A writer that was hired by Mrs. Drake to finally throw an encompassing tell-all [in a positive light] book revealing the exploits of the Penvellyn name.  I thought he was okay in general, but the typing test he had me perform was idiotic.  Ethel Bosinny: I really wanted to learn more about her and the fact that she startled me a couple time was really laughable. I probably never jumped in a ND game before, but they GOT me! :)  I wanted to learn more about what rituals/customs she was intent on passing down through the family lineage with Jane.  Ned Nickerson : Supportive as always.  Loulou: A parrot that really DID get on your nerves after awhile. The voice was poorly-acted [sounding like a human mimicking a parrot] by whatever actor was in charge of that performance.  Also, if you were going to add catch-phrases, try adding at least TEN more. ""We are going to need a bigger boat."" only goes so far after the 12th time heard.  CUMUL SCORE: - 4 = 89  SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS: One of the best scores I have heard in a ND game to date! Very enticing and it got you into the spirit of the adventure. Graphics, although not top-notch as the others, had designers working 24/7 because the immensity of what they had to  accomplish. So many areas of the manor were majestically done!  CUMUL SCORE: + 4 = 93  PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES:  I agree with past reviewers that there was a certain level of puzzle-solving that made it too hard for the casual gamer.  Mindlessly strutting around looking for leads would have added an extra five hours to my gameplay NEEDLESSLY, if I didn't short-cut with a walkthrough [didn't cheat the actual puzzles mind you]. I think they were too difficult for their own good and am trying very hard to remember if I actually enjoyed any of them.  The only thing that comes to mind is Skull & Bones and how Jane would ask "" Do you have any SPY-dehs??"" in her english accent. :) Go Dig!  CUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 94  ADVENTURE ENDING: Now I don't mind not getting the culprit right, but when the set-up doesn't equal the payoff, I can get pretty upset. Why was I bothered to learn about this family in a historical sense? Okay, I forgive that, but here is what is NOT forgivable....absolutely no character  resolutions for the player. 1) What was that wolf thing in the bushes? Was it real? If not, explain how it was faked! Same poor excuse like in SAWE 2) Could Linda's ailments actually happen according to the explanation? No! 3) What became of Linda except ""the family [Hugh/Linda/Jane] learned to grow together"". I want instant reactions to what happened immediately when the culprit was revealed...not a flimsy gloss-over going forward. 4) No TRUE culprit punishment after all I invested? [13 game hours] 5) What happened to all the side characters and their finality?  CUMUL SCORE: - 10 = 84  * PART 2 *  I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to take weeks! Well, it took me four days  and I gave myself a Detective Score Of : 56  My Strong Points: I battled to stay interested to the history of the family and even  memorized their family tree! [Where did that ultimately get me? 97% useless knowledge]  I solved the difficult games, but lets face it,  I am not spending four hours monkeying around with moving walls again and again. Why did I have to CONSTANTLY maneuver the gargoyle & dragon to enter the West & East secret rooms? Couldn't the developers put it as RESOLVED instead of the tediousness of doing the steps ten times throughout the game? I punished myself nonetheless, but especially because I had the culprit all wrong.  My Weak Points: General frustration with the game interface and it clouded my judgements on the linear tasks ahead.  OVERALL GAME SCORE: 84 + 56/ 2 = 70 [ C - ]  BOTTOMLINE: I'll not begrudge HER on how they wanted to resolve the main plotline, but for God Sakes clean up the ending so the Nancy Drew fans have some resolution on the other fifteen things that were occuring. We have invested countless hours and I learned nothing of how certain tricks were done and why. Should I just accept ""Because the culprit enjoyed lying""?  Thus far, on my list of the 21 completed ND games, BLACKMOOR ranks.....# 18  1) GHOST DOGS OF MOON LAKE * 88.5 2) THE SHATTERED MEDALLION * 87 3) GHOST OF THORNTON HALL * 86.5 4) HAUNTING CASTLE MALLOY * 85.5 5) TREASURE ROYAL TOWER * 84 6) HAUNTED CAROUSEL * 83 7) WHITE WOLF ICICLE CREEK * 82.5 8) DANGER DECEPTION ISLAND * 81 9) MESSAGE HAUNTED MANSION * 80 10) WARNINGS AT WAVERLY * 78 11) SHADOW AT WATER'S EDGE * 77.5 12) THE CAPTIVE CURSE * 77 13) SECRET SHADOW RANCH * 76 14) TRAIL OF THE TWISTER * 72 15) PHANTOM OF VENICE * 71.5 16) TOMB OF THE LOST QUEEN * 71 17) THE SILENT SPY * 70.5 18) CURSE BLACKMOOR MANOR * 70 19) ALIBI IN ASHES * 69.5 20) THE DEADLY DEVICE * 69 21) SECRETS CAN KILL [REMAST] * 68",372

So far I've only played around with the basic features but I am impressed with how easy they are to use. I highly recommend this program to others.",65
4918.0,328,5.0,"There are a lot more features in this software bundle than I realized at first.  My main interest was in the video software because I wanted to make some short movies and be able to save them to different formats such as Youtube or to be viewed on a TV with a DVD.  This software helps you to capture, edit and then share your movies from your video camcorder, mobile device, USB camera or other movies or clips you have on your computer. When you start it up you see a timeline where you can capture your video or move it from a file on your computer.  There you can edit things like titles, fonts, sound, themes and the order in which your movie clips play.  You can also do slideshows or a combination of still shots and movie clips.  It's easy to do a simple movie, dragging around the clips in the timeline and adding written info or voice-overs to the different clips.  When you're finished you can save it in a variety of different size files and formats or upload to Youtube or Vimeo.  (I've never tried Vimeo).  I found the program very user friendly although a little slow at times.  There is a learning curve if you want to get into more than just the basic things.  There is a manual that comes with it but in my experience, just spending the time playing around with it was the way to go.  It's easy to make a quick movie that you can export to your mobile phone or burn to a DVD or upload to an internet site. You can also take more time and do something really creative, but still with all the bells and whistles that make it pretty painless. For example you can modify the playback speed, multi trim your video, enhance the color, brightness or sound or even add overlay clips. The software came with a manual of 213 pages of good instruction including photos of the different screens. I was also impressed with the section, including pictures, of the equipment and cables you need to connect a camcorder or other device to your computer in order to import movies. It makes it easy for the beginning filmmaker to get started. I had already installed a firewire card on this computer but even if I hadn't installed one before, the instructions, along with photos would have made it easy to do.  Like all video programs that I've used, this is really a memory hog and I sometimes experienced slowness or stalls for a few minutes when I was trying to do something.  I don't think any video app in this price range is without it's quirks and this doesn't have any more or less than other such programs.  It suits my purposes for home movies or videos to share on the internet.  Both the video and photo applications come with user manuals.  I thought they were helpful in getting me started and then the rest was mostly intuitive.  I've used other video and photo editing software, so I'm not completely new to this type of program.  I think if you've never used this type of software before you have to plan on spending some time using it and trying the different features.  I tend to learn and remember things that I use often and then look up or experiment with new features that I haven't tried before.  There is a lot more here than most people would ever need.  The Photo Editing software is also included in the bundle. Overall I like using this program.  It has lots of great editing features that are typical in this type of program, plus a few that are unique.  Using Express Lab is a great way to make quick changes to photos without having to go through a lot of steps or a learning curve.  I especially like the ""suntan brush"" feature in the ""Makeover"" section.  It transforms your cursor into a nice little brush that is like using a self-tanning cream to make the people in your photo look like they spent the afternoon on the beach playing volleyball.  OK, so you now look like you were out in the sun all day, but the exercise part is missing and you still look a little pudgy?  Use the ""Thinify"" feature and you look like you sweated off a couple pounds while you were getting that suntan.  And you use the cursor to specify which people get the magic weight loss treatment so your big fat cousin stays just the way he is!  Well, the tool's not perfect because it makes your head thinner too, and then it looks kind of bizarre, but if you just want to do a little tweaking it's kind of a cool feature.  Another fun feature of in the ""Makeover"" section is the ""Toothbrush"" feature.  You haven't used those whitener strips on your teeth in some time and all the coffee and tea makes your teeth look a little dingy in that close-up photo?  Just click on the ""Toothbrush"" button and point your cursor at those pearly whites and they become, well, pearly white!  Yeah, you could do the same thing with a paintbrush in Photoshop or even in the main section of this program, but you'd have to be careful that you didn't whiten the spaces between your teeth or your lips since you don't want to look really strange.  This program knows not to do that and just whitens the teeth.  Eyes a little red?  The ""Eye drop"" feature takes care of that with a click on the mouse.  Want to make your photo look like like one from 1839?  Use the ""Time Machine"" feature under ""Photo Effects"" and you can change your photo from today to look as though it were created anywhere from 1839 to the 60's and choose the camera it was ""taken"" with to a box camera or other special effects.  Of course you always have the black and white or sepia options.  It has tons of other features, these are just a few.  I'm looking forward to using it to create some 12 x 12 inch digital scrapbook pages.  I love using this program for a quick fix on photos and also for it's ability to organize all of my pictures.  The things I don't like are that it's a memory hog and sometimes runs somewhat slow on my Pentium 2 Ghz computer running Windows XP with 2 GB of ram.  It's not terrible or anything, just a little slow to load and sometimes doesn't execute commands instantly.  I also find the program not to be very intuitive on some features, but that could be because I've been using Photoshop and Photoshop Elements in the past and am used to those programs.  I'd still recommend this program to anyone who likes touching up or doing creative things with photos.  This bundle also includes Corel Painter Essentials 4.  With this program you can take any photo and do all sorts of special effects such as making it look like an old oil painting, a charcoal drawing, a line drawing, chalk drawing and many many more.  I've spent hours playing with this and trying different combinations of brushes and tones.  Some results were very good and others were pretty so-so.  I would say that pictures of scenery seem to turn out better than close ups of people's faces.  It takes a while to render each photo on my computer but it's fun to watch.  All in all, this software has a lot of features for the money, more than I'll probably ever have reason to use.  But it's kept me busy for many hours, most of them enjoyable.  It's not perfect, but I think it's a good deal.",110

5530.0,371,5.0,"It's been a long time. I am at least a few years behind on upgrades. I really haven't had any reason to do so up until now. I recently had been concerned about my old software working correctly with Windows 8.1, which I moved to, and also with the coming of Windows 10. This was a very reasonable offer that motivated me to migrate from OmniPage 15 to 18. I like OmniPage very much. I have been using it for much more than a decade. I have tried other OCR software, but I believe that I am spoiled by OmniPage. Their new editions, however, are very expensive--better put: cost-prohibitive--and provide little new functionality as far as I am concerned in proportion to the money that is spent. This edition installs and seems to work well on Windows 8.1. It registered quickly with the given Serial Number, Activated flawlessly, and so I am satisfied. I knew eventually I would have to upgrade to newer software, but was hanging on waiting for an opportunity like this to come. Hopefully, it will allow me to be able to seek another reasonably priced upgrade in the future, but as you can see, I am not in a hurry to spend more money on this!",716

I also purchased Photo Shop Elements at the same time, but find myself spending more time with Paint Shop Pro.  Actually, no editing program has it all, accept possibly the very expensive version of Photo Shop.  But that is beyond my financial capabilities.

12098.0,773,3.0,"I had the chance to review this vehicle tracking fob and let me start by saying the idea is great, you plug this into your vehicles ODB port, which is very easy to access on most modern cars. It simply plugs in and you are done. It uses a cellular signal to broadcast it's location, speed, braking, etc. It does a good job at that.  So why have I knocked a few stars off? Accuracy, I used this solely for a period of 2 weeks, while it was running I had Google Maps with another tracking app open on my phone and monitored my speed real time and over 50% of the reports of speeding were inaccurate when traveling in residential and rural areas, most of the time the speed limit of the road was not marked correctly within the map so it reported a false positive. The device got it right every time on the interstate, but on local roads it consistently said I was speeding when I wasn't, and there was a variance of 10mph in many cases.  Additionally when looking at the ""route replay"" feature on the app my tracks did NOT match the roads on those rural roads, in a few cases I was driving between 2 roads, in a few other cases it had me on the next road over, the accuracy for me was NOT reliable. Perhaps I got a bad unit to test.  This IS useful to get data on your braking and driving, but after my use of this I would highly recommend you NOT use this as the judgement of whether you punish your teen, fire an employee, etc. It's simply not as accurate as it should be in my test scenarios, and I state again, I did these tests solely monitoring my own driving, I was not observing anyone else's driving and then took their word for the results, this was done carefully in different controlled scenarios.",490

I'm sure other tax software works just as well, and offers the benefit of a lower cost. I stick with TurboTax mainly because it always has worked well for me, and I just prefer to stick with what I know will work.

4727.0,317,5.0,"I am completely amazed at all of the negative reviews regarding this product.  I'm a recent Mac convert and was devastated if not completely amazed that no company has really created a blow your socks off financial suite for the OS.  I have tried every personal finance software for the Mac that I could find, either via google or the app store.  This included, SEE Finance, MoneyWell, Money Dance, iBank, YNAB to name just a few.  Nothing, and I mean nothing connected to my banks (which have direct download) as smooth as the Quicken for Windows did.  The last straw was one of the programs actually reported your available balance on a credit card in it's summary as your balance owing.  The solution was to make a manual entry initially to ""force"" it to report correctly.  Not gonna happen.  So, out of sheer desperation and being willing to toss away $19 on this download I went for it.  I have to say, what is wrong with you people?  This worked FLAWLESSLY the first time for me.  Every bank was found and every account was downloaded perfectly that I wanted it to.  As a matter of fact, it also grabbed one of my banks that has a loan and it grabbed my insurance bill!  Even the Windows version wouldn't do that.  But as I type this in, I'm staring at my updated and downloaded loan balance.  FANTASTIC!  Another brilliant idea is the section where you can review all transactions downloaded on one screen and not have to move from account to account.  Budgeting seems simple enough and will work for me.  Nothing else I tried even came close to the effectiveness of this ""essentials"" stripped down version.  For $19 this is an absolute steal.  When iBank and others want $59 or even more, forget about it.  I have been with Quicken since the DOS days and then moved on to Money (which I thought was a better product) then back to Quicken on m PC.

9055.0,579,4.0,"Many things can be said about this and competing products, most of them being aimed at editor features and render speed.  I'm going to stick to one subject only because this is where Corel gets it right where nobody else is:  ACTUAL QUALITY OF HD OUTPUT.  If all you want to do is make cute little youtube videos, then any junky editor will do because quality simply does not matter.  But If you want to make BluRays, listen up, Pespecially your PowerDirector fans:  I try every version of PowerDirector (including 12) that comes out, and end up running right back to Corel's VSX.  Why?  because no matter what kind of editing process/features you may enjoy about these two products, what does it all matter if the HD output is garbage?  Are you using this software to enjoy the editing process or are you using it to create good looking content?  Corel produces flawlessly beautifull, crystal clear HD content (I'm talking BluRay production here).  PowerDirector doesn't, and CANT.  Time and time again, no matter how I try with PD's limited controls, I can't get PD's BlueRay output to look good on a 55"" flatscreen.  It's grainy, pixilated, especialyl during pans or action sequences, which pixelate and blur BADLY.  Also, there is no render quality settings to fix this.  If you use PowerDirector, you are STUCK with this.  Corel, even with a bit if a dumbed down interface (but not much), has a boatload of output and quality options that allow you to drill down as far as you want to go to control every aspect of ouput quality and format.  This is really where Corel stomps all over PowerDirector - and always has.  Between these two products, there is only one difference that actually matters:  Output quality.  Everything else is just a bunch of worthless fluff.  The new 64-bit version just means that Corel's VSX is now on the same playing field as PowerDirector speed-wise, and PowerDirector has just lost its only bragging right against VSX.  But Corel has the edge in output options and quality, now making Corel's VideoStudio Pro the superior product.  No contest - because output quality is EVERYTHING.",578

9284.0,592,4.0,"I don't feel the need to dive into depth in this review, as there are so many other good ones here. As always, Family Tree Maker is a solid product and worth the investment. The feature suite is rich and it gets the job done nicely. Where my real complaint lies is the map. This has been a feature that's been in the last few iterations of FTM and, while I love the idea, the implementation drives me bonkers.  The idea behind the mapping feature is that you can attach people and events to actual locations on a map. It's great for setting up to-do lists, getting a visual look at your family history, and so on. The problem, however, is with formatting. I have yet to figure out what it insists locations be entered as they are. For instance, I have ancestors buried in a cemetery in ""Baileyville"" TX. This is, of course, how I've entered them. FTM, however, doesn't like ""Baileyville, TX"" and gives me a ""?"" beside any entries. Basically, it can't find ""Baileyville"" in its database. And yet, on the map view, it drops the pin right on--you guessed it--Baileyville, TX! So it can't find Baileyville, TX in its database, but seems to find it just fine on the map. Go figure. At others times, it will insist on a County for a location and, even when I duly enter it in, will still kick it back as being somehow wrong. There really seems to be no rhyme or reason to when a location will be kicked back as unrecognized. This is sad, too, because the feature is really nice when it works. It's helped me clear up some sloppy editing (like when I once entered ""Grimes Co, TX (Last name was spelled <edited>.  Age was given as 64.  Occupation listed as farmer.  Real estate value listed as $47,000.)"" for a location!)  Perhaps I shouldn't be so harsh, but this is a feature that's advertised prominently and has been around for years. There are ways around these issues, but none of them feel reliable to me (and ancestry software should be reliable above anything). If they could fix these map problems, I'd give it 5 stars in a minute. Until then, however, I'm keeping the pressure on.

9053.0,579,5.0,"I occasionally do video projects, so I was excited to see the new version of Corel Studio. I find it to be exceptionally powerful, with lots of effects and good performance in editing and rendering.  The program came on two DVDs: one for the program (32 or 64 bit) and one for the extra add-on programs. Installation was painless, except that there was no integrated install screen; the two disks are stand-alone, and one might think at first that the second disk is for 32 bit or something. Not a big deal, but it would have been nice to have better labels than ""Disk 1"" and ""Disk 2"". Several of the add on programs tried to install the .net framework (which is already installed in Windows 8), but functioned fine. My system is an AMD Phenom 6 at 3.4 Ghz, with a 250Mb SSD that I used for the program, and a 2 TB data disk. I have 16 Gb of memory.  For new folks, there is a program called FastFlick, which opens up a set of templates that can be used to rapidly create a video. From what I can tell it is best suited to making picture slide shows, although various elements can be edited, and custom music can be used. But it pales in comparison to the capabilities of the main program.  For experienced users, or those wanting to be, the program offers seemingly endless possibilities for creating a sophisticated video. There are many options for transitions, editing, titles, music, mixing, and, well, just about anything. The program works by importing media files into the main program, then dragging the files onto a timeline. After that one can use additional tracks to add titles, music, additional video overlays, FX transitions, and many other options. A small preview area offers basic editing and clipping, plus full screen or partial screen preview. After the video is completed, there are options to ""share"" it, which means save in various formats: Computer (AVI, MPEG, H.264, MPEG-2, or WMV), phone optimized, Web optimized (HTML-5 projects are possible), DVD (including menus), or 3D. The program features full multi-processor support and 4K (I don't have any 4K video to test it with, however). The interface is advertised as more streamlined, and I did indeed find that it seemed to work better (particularly the add-in programs). Also included is a stand-alone handy screen capture/recording program, which would be good for creating presentations showing how a computer program is run. There are a number of templates, which are basically the components of the FastFlick program, but broken apart for individual use in the main program; these would provide a new user with some place to start. For those so inclined, the program integrates with a camera to perform stop-motion.  Performance wise, I rendered a 4 minute video in 9 minutes, which is a bit better than previous versions of the program.  Documentation is strictly online via a PDF file that can be either viewed or downloaded. The add-ons bring up a help file when needed; I found the manual and add-in files to be well written and useful. When the program opens up, one is offered the opportunity to view some tutorials on the ""discovery center"", which requires registration. There are additional templates and such available on line once registration is complete.  There are a number of add-ons bundled with the program. They are pretty easy to use; simply drag them to the clip, and then open the options and customize the effect - thus they are plug-ins and not stand-alone. They are found in the FX portion of the program. Titles include:  Boris Graffiti 6 - Animated titles Newblue Colorfast - color correction ProDad Mercalli SE - video stabilization (worked very well) ProDad Vitascene V2 LE - this has a series of special effect screens proDAD RotoPen - Produces a nice pen effect across the screen. proDAD Handscript Animation - allows some custom movement of the screen NewBlue Motion effect - Smear, liquify, etc. effects  Summary: A powerful program that needs some time to learn, but allows the user to put out basic projects fairly quickly, or complex projects with a bit more work.

3785.0,244,4.0,"Like most other reviewers, I agree that Windows Home Server (WHS) is a pretty good product, and I recommend it as a good solution for backup and file sharing in a home environment. Having said that, the product strikes me as a ""first release"" that was put together at relatively low cost by Microsoft and thus suffers from a few limitations.  Like many others these days, I have a small home network of computers owned by several family members who have typical needs such as: - File sharing: have a central ""library"" for pictures, videos, downloads, etc. that can be shared by all users, and that is kept secure (protected from hard disk failure and from inadvertent damage by users). - Backup: regularly and reliably back up the hard disks of each computer to a different hard drive. - Print sharing: provide common access to several different printers.  To do this, I put together a low-cost, low-power ""mini-server"" that I built using Intel's Atom 330 processor on a mini-ITX board in a small form factor case with 2 WDC 1-TB ""green"" drives - a setup that is very quiet and draws less than 40 watts of power so it can be left on all the time.  I have tried running Windows XP Pro and Ubuntu Linux on it to do the items listed above, but didn't find either to be completely satisfactory.  Then I discovered WHS, so downloaded and tried the free 120-day evaluation copy. My experience with that was worth the cost of purchasing WHS, so I did.  However, WHS does have a few limitations and quirks that potential buyers should be aware of:  * Microsoft did a pretty good job of covering up the complications of the product's Windows Server 2003 underpinnings through the use of a remote WHS Console for connected machines, but this is incomplete and you still need to access the WHS machine directly via a directly-attached monitor/kbd/mouse or via RDP, even though you are presented with a screen in WHS that warns you against this.  But for certain tasks such as applying fixes you still need to access the machine directly.  * It is specifically not intended by MS to be a print server - a very disappointing omission, because that is one the normal ""shared"" missions of a server.  I suspect MS omitted this because installing printers is not something they could easily fit into the WHS Console.  You can configure shared printers on WHS as you would in Windows Server 2003 - and I did - but one of my printers just wouldn't install for some reason.  This whole area needs more work.  * As many others have pointed out, you can't easily upgrade from the eval version to the product version without doing a reinstall and re-registering users.  Fortunately your data is preserved.  * I *strongly* recommend using multiple hard disks in your WHS machine to take advantage of the very nice ""duplication"" feature that MS has built in that replicates a copy of the precious data you have stored on WHS.  Much easier than trying to do this via RAID.  * Another badly-needed missing feature is some type of mechanism that provides more control over what individual users can do to shared data.  WHS only provides primitive controls such as granting read or write permissions, but this is not enough.  For example, I want other family members to be able to add their photos to the shared photo library but not to be able to delete items, e.g. a ""contribute"" level of access to prevent a user from inadvertently destroying shared items.  (I often use Microsoft's free SyncToy to do this.)  * The fact that there has only been one release of WHS (albeit updated with 3 service packs), that it still runs on a fairly old base system (Windows Server 2003), and that MS has not actively promoted the product does create some concern that it was only a trial balloon by MS that might not have a future and thus will leave users stranded.  There have been rumors of a new version, but until we hear the facts this is still an area of concern.

12638.0,497,5.0,"I've used the Peachtree package years back when operating a small business so I'm familiar with the legacy background of Sage.  In many ways it operates the same ways but they've tweaked some functions to leverage the power of new hardware.  Some may say they've added so many features over the years that it's become a hodgepodge of glued together functions.  Perhaps so, but in essence it works and does what it needs to do.  A complete rework of the interface is needed eventually but that will undoubtedly add more in the way of costs.  Overall functionality wise, this is a powerful piece of software that can easily handle up to medium sized businesses especially with the 3 user package (which you'll pay a pretty penny for). Before people get put off by the cost, remember that custom made software will easily cost you ten times as much and probably not as good in functions.  Operational wise, it ran perfectly smooth and fluid on my I7 3570k, which is a higher end system but hardly costly in this day and age so anyone could easily get one without breaking a sweat.  Therefore if you're having performance issues, might want to just spend a little to get a better system.",507
9038.0,579,5.0,"Corel has really done it this year.  We see the most significant update since years with X7 and many more useful add-ons.  Here's what's new for Ultimate X7.  *** At the end of the review I'll compare X7 Ultimate to X7 Pro ***  UPDATE #1 - 64-Bit processing. This is huge!  All previous versions were 32-bit, meaning that the new 64-bit X7 can process videos at twice the power.  To get a grasp on this concept, think of your computer processor as being a tube that can either be 32 or 64 inches wide. When you have the smaller 32 inch size, less information can flow through and the tube is more likely to  full and ""bottleneck"". Bottlenecks are when the maximum information is flowing through the tube.  This causes other processing to slow down and your system to load slower because each process has to wait for the others to finish before it can begin. If you 64 inch wide tubes, then there is 2x as much room for information to pass through before the computer bottlenecks and slows down.  Some people online ran some speed tests and they found that the new VideoStudio X7 beats last year's VideoStudio X6 by rendering up to 68 percent faster for HD multitrack projects with hardware acceleration, up to 153 percent for 4K projects, and up to 854 percent with smart rendering (processing only the changed regions of the video.  This is nearly twice to more than twice as fast as last year for standard rendering and nearly 9 times as fast for smart rendering (less processing done on each video when rendering, more carryover from original video clip).  These are amazing gains!  Since Windows 7, most computers are running 64-bit Windows.  Now Corel is running at 64-bit as well.  This is the greatest improvement - beyond all the add-ons and plug-ins.  This is a true core software update.  This is alone is enough to want any user of Corel VIdeoStudio (any version) to upgrade to X7. Thanks Corel!  UPDATE #2 New HD add-ons and effects.  Since the software is now 64-bit, Corel has given us higher resolution (1920 x 1080) HD templates, backgrounds, and color patterns.  UPDATE #3 - FastFlick.  This feature is aimed at the beginner video user or people wanting to spend less time making videos.  FastFlick is a one-click processing feature that adds may effects, themes, transitions, etc onto a single video, series of video clips or series of photos...immediately processing it and rendering it as a brand new stylized video.  Basically, select your own videos or photos, then select the FastFlick theme you want, click start and come back to a completed final video that is ready to upload and watch.  UPDATE #4 - Cleaner Layout.  This is a minor change, but still important enough to list.  They cleaned up the layout / video editing screen to give us more space, less clutter.  The look is not closer to Corel Paintshop, making it easier for a person to use both softwares.  UPDATE #5 -  Discovery Center Video Tutorials.  This feature I really like. There are so many features to VideoStudio X7 that discovering them all on your own is very unlikely.  The video tutorials in the Discovery Center (access by a little blue button at the top right toolbar) guide a person through many of the great features and quickly teach anyone how to use the software.  I personally love video tutorials over written tutorials (which Corel also includes as PDFs, accessible through the main menu as well).  Watching the process is better than reading about it.  So here you have it - the top 5 new updates for Corel VideoStudio X7!  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ULTIMATE X7 and PRO X7 VERSIONS  VideoStudio Pro X7 vs. VideoStudio Ultimate X7  These two versions are basically the same except that Ultimate X7 gives you 7 special effects apps that are not in the Pro version.  All of these are very high quality, helping you to create more professional looking videos.  Other than that, the software is identical..  1) NewBlue FX ColorFast - Color correction tools to improve the look of the video (either more realistic color corrections or more abstract - you control it).  2) NewBlue FX Motion Effects - Over 100 preset motion effects to create some very creative looks.  3) Boris Graffiti 6 - A large collection of titles and graphics.  4) proDAD Mercalli SE - Video stabilization plus advanced features that create the shaky camera effects that are very popular in today's videos.  5) proDAD VitaScene LE - Even more transitions, filters and film-style effects.  6) proDAD Handscript Animation - Handwriting effects that animate as the video plays - such as signing a signature.  Great for titles.  7) proDAD RotoPen - Rotoscope style animated effects for maps, graphics and photos. Rotoscope is where the video turns into a sketchpad or animated cartoon look.  So this is a lot of great features to get for only $20. Get Ultimate.  MY PERSONAL OPINION  The long story short.  3 years ago (with Corel VideoStudio X5) I switched over from using Adobe Premiere Elements and I haven't looked back.  I use the Corel VideoStudio software about once every week or two for 3-4 hours, plus periods of daily use when I have larger projects.  I like to get the newest version each year because Corel is always adding more plug-ins, effects, filters, etc.  The bottom line is Corel VideoStudio is the best bang for your buck and a flawless performer.  I feel it blows away Adobe Premiere Elements and the other $100-ish video software.",1168

When I first installed the software, I wasn't expecting much - but after using it on several occasions, I can say that it is intuitive, easy to work with, and produces the same type of effects and functionality that I would use in Photoshop at 1/6 of the price.

9988.0,625,2.0,"I've been a TaxCut (now ""H&R Block Tax Software"") user for nearly a decade, but I've always been curious as to whether or not the grass was really greener on the other side. I finally had a chance to see what my TurboTax friends have been raving about, and something tells me, we have very different tax needs.  TurboTax does a fine job of basic ""I have a job, a mortgage, and kids"" taxes, like you should expect from any not-free tax program. Plugging in hypothetical numbers for the 2014 tax year, the flow of TurboTax's interview isn't a huge departure from H&R Block, and is arguably easier. And, if you're expecting a big return, the 10% premium on receiving it as an Amazon gift card is very attractive.  But that's where the positives end. If you do any investing -- and I mean ANY investing, you're dead in the water with this product.  I saw on the feature matrix that the twice-as-expensive version was recommended for Schedule D. I make some complex options trades occasionally, and even my beloved H&R Block needs lots of help understanding how they should be entered, so I wasn't adverse to doing a lot of Schedule D manually. Thing is: you can't with this version of TurboTax. It's not a matter of the calculation feature being absent -- it's that you can't do it at all.  To be clear: I'm not saying ""I can't believe they want another forty bucks just to calculate an iron condor option strategy that carried over two tax years from December 2013 to January 2014!"". I'm saying if Grandma gave you 10 shares of Acme Corporation stock as a graduation gift, and you just sold it in 2014 to put towards a down payment on a house you bought. TurboTax will happily help you with the home purchase, but will do absolutely nothing for you to pay capital gains tax on the tiny number of shares you've had. H&R Block will, and will do it very well.

Only through consumers taking a stand on this will any of it change - there are other solutions for OCR like ABBYY, but they seem to have the same issues. Regardless, if you can get past the imperfections and overall buggy performance, Omnipage does function for the most part. I was able to create and edit a few PDF's which saved with no issues, as well as convert a few others from SkyDrive.

H&R Block continues to change the name of their software (for years it was called TaxCut, and I still refer to it by that name) but Ive probably been using it for the last 15+ years. Its simple and easy and it is about $20 less than the comparable version of Turbo Tax (the other major tax software).  I do have a few issues with it though. One is that  about 3 years ago  they eliminated one of the most useful reports. It was called Two-year summary in which you could see line by line comparisons between the current and prior year. This was a good way to see why the tax went up or down and would help find any items you may have missed. I don't know why this was eliminated but I really miss it.  The other issue with the H&R block software is that the Deluxe Fed and Stare pkg comes with only ONE state return included. If you worked in a different state or moved during the year you need to buy and DOWNLOAD the additional states. They used to be pricey ay $29.95 for each state but this year it is $39.95 (plus tax) for the simple download! (The Fed and State software itself is actually less than these extra states! (And not all the forms are there  for some states there are no amended forms  though the forms do exist on state websites  for no charge.

If you are already familiar with Photoshop and/or Lightroom, then CC will be intuitive to use. I am moderate in my skills and found the online tutorials very helpful. As with any new software, expect to spend some time navigating all the features and advanced techniques available.  From Microsoft to Norton Security, many companies are shifting to subscription based services. But not all are worth it. With Adobe CC, the industry's best photo editing software is now available to many who would not otherwise be able to afford it.

9483.0,604,4.0,"I got this Corel PaintShop Pro X7 hoping it would be a good alternative to Photoshop. I'll warn you that this is a pretty complex program and there is no way you could possibly list all the features included in it. But here are the most interesting ones:  BASIC FUNCTIONS - This a highly functional photo processing software. - It comes with lots of fun and practical built-in filters. - You can crop, straighten, fix red eye, add text, convert to black and white or adjust colors/saturation  ADVANCED FUNCTIONS - You can clone items - Remove scratches  and unwanted objects - Apply special effects like time warp (to make photos look old) - Selective Focus - Distortion  This software allows you to apply layers which gives you the freedom to experiment with different looks and still keep your original image until you are ready to merge them. It also has a cool ability to add 3D effects, turn your photos into pencil drawings, paintings, and more. If you're looking for a program with similar functions to Photoshop but don't like the Photoshop price, this may fit the bill",735

3129.0,179,4.0,"Symantec's 360 has a surprisingly excellent product in version two of this made for home use item. The product integrates very well with Office 2007 ( the Full Enterprise Version , as well as lesser  types).With the full MS Office and Norton 360 to be installed,two reboots is common. Norton 360 covers PC Security, Identity Protection,Backup and PC Tuneup in broad terms. When errors in install occur, a reinstall utility covers and easily fixes problems. The setup shuts down Ghost until install is complete, and also until the backup setup is decided upon since 360 has its own backup technique. After initial setup, the configuration is pretty much automatic. All items are set up on what seems to be a standard basis, with the exception of the backup routine, which is something that can be turned on or off ( unlike the other three major sections) so that you can use the Norton GHOST backup should you want to do so. Its an impressive piece of software, great price, installs and operates extremely well. For a family machine with a non-technical or partially technical background, this is a great piece of software that operates well, and operates automatically. It fits a niche market, and does not , as some say, cross over into some of the regular Norton areas; especially since it is simple and easy to use.",463

2800.0,133,5.0,"I am a computer geek. I have a lot of devices, many of those with ethernet ports. For instance, I have a PRISMIQ Media Player that hooks to the TV to watch videos and photos stored on the computer.  That device has BOTH an ethernet port for wired lans, and a PCMCIA slot to insert a wireless networking card, but it must be of a given brand and model (from a list of supported cards).  I wanted to hook the device to my LAN without drilling holes on walls, and I didn't want to have to seek a special pcmcia card. So I went with one Sony PCWA-DE80. I connected to the Prismiq ethernet port and Bingo!, instant wireless connectivity to my Netgear 802.11a Wireless Access Point!.  A bonus with one of these devices you can say GOODBYE to WIFI driver issues. You just need a WIFI access point next to your adsl or cable modem, and this device. Then you can hook ANYTHING with a working ethernet port to your wireless lan!. It could be  a PC or any other device (could be a game console!). You plug the Sony ethernet-to-wifi converter into the device's RJ45 ethernet port and ... instant wireless connectivity. As far as the PC or  device is concerned, it's talking to a wired ethernet, even while it's not, as the sony devices bridges wifi to wired ethernet networks!.  Setup is a breeze. Just point your browser to the devices's IP address and enter your wifi configuration data (supports wep up to 128 bits), the IP address that you want assigned to it, and that's it!. Then when you plug this unit to any device with an ethernet port, that device will immediately connect to your wifi network!. I even used one of these boxes to get instant WiFi connectivity on my old lan server running IBM OS/2, an operating system that doesn't have plenty of WiFi cards supported (if any).  Another bonus: switch operating systems painlessly, don't worry about the availability of wifi drivers!. I test software for a living, so I often find myself installing several flavors of Linux on my notebook. However, availability of Wifi drivers for Linux is scarce. So, instead of having to thinker with the computer, I just tell linux to use the notebook's ethernet port, and I then plug the SONY ethernet to wifi converter and that's it. Instant connection and no need to drill holes on the walls.  The downside: It's expensive, like most Sony gear. You can probably find several less expensive ""ethernet to Wi-Fi"" converters on the market, but to my knowledge the Sony ones are the ONLY that support the 5 Ghz 802.11a standard!, all cheaper devices work ONLY in the 2.4 Ghz frequency, using either 802.11b or 802.11g. I choose 802.11a because, while older, the 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference from 2.4 Ghz cordless phones, microwave ovens (did you know your microwave oven operates at 2.4 ghz?), and wireless security cameras, all of which pollute the 2.4 Ghz frequency spectrum.  The PCWADE80 works BOTH in 2.4 Ghz frequency (802.11b ang ""g"") and also in 802.11a. Unlike the previous model (PCWADE50) this one claims to support 72mbps ""turbo"" mode in 802.11a!

Then, I upgraded Windows 7 to Windows 10.  It worked on both systems without crashing either one.  Woohoo!  One of the things I noticed right off the bat is screen video capture.  I'm so happy to have that.  For years, the only way for me to screen capture was point a camera at my screen (yeah, I know about free software).

My old video editor could only handle four.  I haven't challenged it yet, but it is the coolest feature.  That can really make a video look all pro.  I'm still learning my way around this software, so maybe there are things that are there that I don't know about.  So far, I've made a few basic videos for YouTube I've found that and VideoStudio is similar in feel to PowerDirector, but some things aren't as intuitive, or maybe I've just been with PowerDirector so long that anything else feels alien.

4443.0,292,5.0,"I've used AVG for a long time and I feel Version 9.0 (this product) is an improvement over the previous versions.  The interface will be instantly recognizable to anyone who has used AVG in the past couple of years.  It remains simple and clean with its intuitive three-tab design that is suitable for both experienced and new users.  COMPONENTS: Here is a list of the three tabs, and a quick synopsis of what the components do.  Overview Tab:   * Anti-Virus: Protection from and removal of viruses, trojans, and worms including infected .EXEs or .DLLs.   * Anti-Spyware: Protection from and removal of spyware, malware, adware.   * Anti-Spam: Protects against spam and phishing attempts, marking suspicious incoming email as [SPAM].   * Firewall: Blocks or permits network traffic on a rule-by-rule, program-by-program basis. 'Gaming Mode' prevents firewall rule pop-ups from interrupting play.  Handy 'Emergency Mode' blocks all internet traffic in the event you feel you are being hacked.   * LinkScanner: Surf-Shield and Search-Shield actively block dangerous websites and scan search engines for threats.   * Anti-Rootkit: Searches out hidden rootkit dangers on your computer.  This scan can be scheduled separately, run with another scan, or manually started.   * System Tools: Like Windows' Task Manager, it shows your running system processes, active network connections, etc but with security levels.   * Email Scanner: Scans outgoing and incoming email for threats.   * Identity Protection: Analyzes and scans your programs in an attempt to prevent the loss of personal information such as passwords and credit card info.   * Web Shield: While using instant messaging programs, prevents you from downloading or exchanging infected files. Resident Shield: Actively scans your files as they are opened, copied, or saved to prevent the activation of threats.   * License: Your license info is displayed here.  This program is for a 2-year subscription for a single computer.   * Update Manager: Set it and Forget it.  Automatically keeps the program up-to-date.  Computer Scanner Tab:   * It's now easier than ever to setup and maintain scans that suit your time and liking.  Want to scan for viruses, adware, and spyware on Monday at 2:00pm, and then scan for Rootkits on Wednesday at 11am?  It's simple to set it all up here, however and whenever you want.  Update Tab:   * Click this tab to begin a manual update of the program and its components.  IMPRESSIONS: The Firewall has undergone major improvement.  It is less obtrusive than the previous version, automatically creating rules for trusted programs/access without bothering you with any annoying 'stop everything and attend to me' pop-ups.  The Computer Scanner interface tab now shines for its easy to use scheduling of single or multiple scans, manual scans of your computer, or manual scans of just selected files.  The Virus Vault and the History could still use some work, but they are perfectly functional as is.  CONCLUSION: I've used AVG free and paid versions for many years, and I think this version of their internet suite is  the best yet.  It's easy to install, runs great on my Windows 7 64-bit, is full-featured without bloatware, has a clean and simple interface for beginners, yet still allows experienced users to tweak the nuts and bolts to their liking.",1140

10604.0,677,4.0,"Corel VideoStudio Ultimate is basically as pro as you can or need to get, if you're an intermediate to advanced movie maker. It's pro enough to where you could edit an actual, moderate budget movie and it would look great. At the same time, it's easy enough to use that just about anyone familiar with computers can get the basics down in seconds. There's plenty of advanced features, too, though. I feel I'm a fairly advanced tech guy and I still discover new effects and tools, so there is definitely a lot to learn and play around with. All in all, it's great software - although before you click 'buy' I would also consider checking out Sony Movie Studio.  Corel VideoStudio and Sony Movie Studio are my go-to video editing software. They are very similar in function and design, but they each have their pros and cons. Corel has better visual effects. Sony is much easier to manipulate audio. I tend to render in Corel but they are able equal on that end. Sony tends to be a hair cheaper and, if you're a true beginner, I would actually suggest starting out there because I feel like the tools are generally easier to use.  OVERALL: If you're tired of being limited by free or ultra-basic video editing software, it's definitely time to upgrade. I highly suggest Corel VideoStudio or Sony Movie Studio. Both software provide exceptional effects and tools to make your footage look at high quality as possible. And with rendering ability all the up to 4K, it's unlikely you'll find yourself limited by the software anytime soon. To be honest, unless you're editing a million dollar movie, I doubt there is anything this software won't be able to do to fit your needs.",1538

While this makes sense given that they have been getting better market share with iOS it is too bad that development of the Mac OS seems to be slowing down a bit. While Snow Leopard shows a lot of advancements from when OS X first came out it certainly is not a mature product. One of the biggest advancements has been spotlight which was announced in Tiger. Steve Jobs wasn't exaggerating when he said that spotlight alone was worth the buying Tiger. While there have been some nice advancements to spotlight since then it still lacks one important feature in that there is no good way to tag files in the OS. With out tagging it is hard to find the file that you are looking for. I don't see why there isn't at least a tagging option under the save as menu. The save as menu has been designed to be so minimalist that they could easy take advantage of the room to add in some tagging features. A tagging cloud could also be an important addition. Also there has been this weird bug in spotlight for the longest time where it shows a folder icon for everything that is a group of items. It doesn't matter if it is a playlist or an iPhoto event or whatever you just get this generic folder icon. The problem with this is that I will often have events, playlists, and regular folders that have the same name. If they all use the icon there is no way to differentiate them from the others.  When browsing the finder I find that I often want to go back to some place that I was at just a few hours earlier. It would be helpful if Apple brought Safari's history feature over to the Finder. They already wrote this feature so it makes sense that they would bring it across since it would hardly even take them any time. Another feature that I think would take little time to write would be if Mac OS automatically relaunched all the programs that you had open the last time the computer was on. They already have this feature for the Finder why can't it do it for other program windows as well? I also miss the sidebar icons that would expand when you would enlarge a window in Tiger. I don't see why they took that feature out.  Some of the most interesting features to the Mac OS have never made it into a shipping release of Mac OS. They have been features in the beta versions only. The beta of Leopard let you grab random files to make a stack in the dock. If you drag random files in to the dock now you will get separate files for each item. This takes up lots of space in your dock and can make it smaller, a big problem if you have a small laptop monitor. The only way to put multiple files in to the dock is if they all happen to be in the same folder. This isn't anywhere near as handy.  The Safari 4 beta had a feature that would display the tabs across the top of the toolbar area. This helped to make the toolbar smaller so that you could see more of the webpage. It also made it difficult to drag the title bar as their where few places to grab it due to having a close box and and handle to drag and move each tab. I really liked this solution and it could have been improved by getting rid of the close button on the tab. Most everyone knows about the Command-W shortcut and that is sufficient (if they don't know that then they really should learn it.) I liked this implementation of tabs because if you only had one window open you could drag it into a group of other tabs. With Safari 5 there is no way to drag a single window into a group of tabs, you have to have two or more widows open to pull this off. This next feature dates waaaay back. In the original version of the Mac OS X public beta 10 years ago there was a features called single window mode the cleared out the clutter by only having one window open while single window mode was activated. This feature was apparently taken out because it confused people who didn't know why only one window was open at a time. The way I see it is if we can have a caps lock key on our keyboard lets you type only capital letters at a given time then why can't you have a key that lets you use only one window at a time? Perhaps it could light up just like the caps lock key can. I think there really needs to be a way to cut down on window clutter so it is worth putting a key on the keyboard that does that. Perhaps it could be on of the F5 and F6 keys that currently aren't assigned a function? Also going back even further in time I have been told that managing fonts in Mac OS 9 was a lot easier due to their being only one fonts folder. If that could be easy again then it would be a big improvement.  I think it would make sense to merge many of their applications together. If you think about a lot of apps different functions they are mainly to browse the files and then do a few basic operations to those files. For an example iPhoto is basically the Finder for photos, iTunes is basically the Finder for music, video, podcasts, etc. What I could envision would be if you started with a window that looked like the Finder with the same filter bar that you have today that lets you pick the kind of file to filter by. Once you select the file the sidebar and the toolbar would match to match that particular type of file. In other words if you selected music the sidebar would instantly change include Genius, Playlists, store etc, the toolbar would instantly include the play button, rewind, fast-forward, etc. This basic concept was played around with in Windows XP but it only include some of the features that you would need. For an example you would select an image file and it would give you some options for making proof sheets but not a lot more. This feature was later removed in the next version of Windows. I don't think that the feature was taken out due to it being a bad idea I think it was taken out because it only did a small amount of what people would expect a photo program to do. But imagine what it would be like if the Finder did all the basic features that you would expect of very basic photo navigating and editing software? Can you image how convenient that would be? You wouldn't have to keep switching between several programs that all have the same basic function (searching for files) when you had to go search for a file there would one be one application to go to. The functionality would of course be limited to some extent. You wouldn't want to turn the program into Photoshop. You would just want to include enough basic features to easily navigate files and to do some lite editing.  Also I think the it is time to get rid of the hierarchy concept. With the introduction of the iPad we can see that we don't need to depend on this way of searching for files. iPad search works fine without having to go into a folder and then into another folder and then into another folder. I think the concept of collections would work as a fine replacement. The files shouldn't need to be in a certain location on the hard disk in order to be grouped together.  There are also a lot of little fine tuning features that need to be addressed. Spaces have no way of being named just generically label by numbers. You can quickly bring all windows from different spaces into one but there is no way to put them back in the spaces where they originally came from. The background in Dashboard is very light which makes it look cluttered if any windows are open. I think the background should be darker. If there is any confusion to how to get back to the regular view then have a close dashboard button. Sidebars often get filled up with lots of smart folders, smart playlists etc. I think it would make sense to just have an option to show the active smart folder so that the rest of the space could be use for other items or to just show some blank space if you don't want a lot going on, or to use use that space to make the icons larger like they did in Tiger. The rest of the smart folders could then reappear using a show / hide button like in iTunes 10.  And finally each version of Windows usually come with one or two features that would be nice to see on the Mac. The one feature that really stood out to me in Windows 7 was how you can search for applications in the start menu and then get a list of recent documents from that application once you hover the mouse over the application name. It would be nice to see this on the Mac with one big improvement. Often when I launch an application I usually open several documents at one time. I would be nice if there were some check boxes to click on to open multiple documents at the same time. Perhaps they could even have a way of showing if a file was part of a certain collection, playlist, album, photo event, etc and showing a related icon next to the file that is was a part of. By adding these additional adjustments they are not just taking an idea but building upon it.  I would wrap up by saying that OS 10 has come a long ways in the 10 years it has been out but Apple shouldn't slow down. There is still a lot to be done.",912
4264.0,282,1.0,"Windows Home Premium came bundled on my new Dell computer (I5 processor). Maybe the 64 bit operating system is necessary to utilize the new Intel processors. Other than that, my experience is that this product has NOTHING to recommend it and I would hardly call it an ""upgrade.""  (1) Older software for which I paid hundreds of dollars now works poorly if at all. As an example, Corel PhotoPaint (which I use for illustrations in technical articles) often crashes with something about a SmartHeap error. AAA Map and Go does not work at all. And I have used Compatibility Mode in an attempt to make them work properly. This in fact did correct a problem with my TomTom software, which is hardly a relic from the 8 bit or 16 bit operating system days.  (2) A laser printer for which I paid a couple of hundred dollars is now a paperweight because there is no 64 bit driver for it. The manufacturer's technical support department claims it did try to develop one but was not successful.  (3) Navigation of files with Windows Explorer is somewhat more difficult with the Windows 7 version than the XP version.  The biggest problem is however security. I have spent (wasted) hours fighting with Windows 7 over permission to modify or delete files and/or registry keys. Even though I am the computer's sole owner and user, many files have four or five ""users"" (e.g. System, Administrator) with different permission levels. I am now trying to install an update to my virus protection software but keep getting slammed with Error 1402, which shuts down the installation. Windows 7 blocked me from trying to apply the comprehensive solution to Error 1402 that I found online. Disabling User Account Control did not work either. My computer is therefore now without virus protection, so Windows 7 is quite frankly now a security exposure for me, although the virus software's manufacturer does offer support and can probably help me on Monday.  I am an experienced user and, despite hours spent searching Microsoft and other sites for a solution to the 1402 error, have not been able to find one. I can only imagine the frustration a regular home user or even small business person might have with this, or how much time even a large corporation's IT department could waste on fixing these issues.  Update August 21 2012  Features (e.g. Windows Update) simply do not work, and neither do the programs Microsoft supplies to correct the problems.  When I run Windows Update, it shows that 16 updates, including those related to security and function, are ready to install. I tell it to go ahead and do so, and it simply tells me the updates were not installed with a worthless error message: ""Windows Update Encountered an Unknown Error""  I ran MicrosoftFixit.wu. LB.25268956865207935.1.1. Run.exe and it returned the message, ""Repair Windows Update Components: Not Fixed"" (another highly useful and informative Microsoft error message). Microsoft FixIt ""Explore Additional Solutions"" is an equally worthless Web page with no specific information whatsoever--only useless generalities.  These are just a couple of examples. This product is poorly designed, unreliable, and quite frankly worse than useless.  Update August 24 2012  Windows now scrambles my desktop icons instead of saving them as I arranged them (e.g. by category and function). Solutions posted online do not work.",444
5800.0,386,4.0,"I'm not the biggest fan of security suites that try to nanny you whenever you open a browser, and in that regard, Trend hasn't really won me over.

Similarly, the ""tune up"" functionality seems like it serves more purpose making customers feel like they don't need to fall for those TV ads that make ridiculous promises. Taken in that light, it's a fine way to stop Grandma from wasting a bunch of money on making her computer 400% faster than when she bought it, or some such nonsense.  As for the underlying virus scanner... It's fast, accurate, and efficient.

2319.0,179,5.0,"I have used in the past MacAfee and AVG antivirus software, I have always struggled to use them as they have multiple add-ons you have to buy and install depending on what area you want to be safe in (though common sense dictates if I use a computer and buy an anti-virus I expect to be safe everywhere when using my computer)  I had the opportunity to grab a copy of Norton 360 and I am very glad I did. Norton 360 is exactly what an anti-virus software needs to be and offers protection in all areas of your computer. Last year I got a Toshiba Satellite that included Windows Vista (which is a pain already) and a trial version of MacAfee, I never understood how to optimize the use of the MacAfee application, it had too many windows and you had to upgrade different things at different times, I was relieved when the trial expired and I got to install a free application called AVG. AVG was good enough for what I needed but suffered from the same thing, 'if you want anti-spy ware you have to download and install this', 'if you want security using the internet install this other thing'...  I uninstalled AVG and installed Norton 360, first of all the installation was quick, it ran for over an hour (as I decided to have it scan my laptop while installing, if you decide not to it may take less time) Once I completed the setup and the application opened I went through the menus in one single screen which is great! The four areas in which the application is divided are in a single screen with submenus when you click over any of them, from this main menu you can scan, setup and even defragment your hard drive (the PC Tune-up feature helps optimize computer performance).  The time it has been installed in my laptop I have not noticed any slowness in performance and it has worked smoothly in the background while I surf the web or work in it.  One feature I liked is the 'Identity protection', in which you setup a profile with your personal info (including credit card number) and it will keep you safe when doing transactions online, you setup a password that Norton360 will require when doing transactions regardless of any security measures the web pages you use have. In my case I access my bank online to do transactions all the time and purchase from web sites, this feature serves as an additional security option. Norton360 also allows me to monitor my network and it even has functionalities that the software that came with my wireless router doesn't have!

Technical support took over 45 minutes to get to me to tell me that IE Version 7 or lower was required.  While the box indicates that the 64 bit Vista Operating System is supported, it also indicates that you have to download the software from the website for that to happen.  Short of buying from the website, I am not sure how you would go about doing that.  Technical Support was no help there.

The biggest hassel is that you have to open the vault each time you want to use something or store something.  This requires logging in each time.  If you are using this to transfer files from one location to another, you need to ensure that the location you are headed to has a 32 bit OS installed and not a 64 bit OS. You also need to ensure that you have a copy of this software installed on any computer you want to use the drive on.  That can be expensive since the software is a single machine license.

3519.0,224,5.0,"Rosetta Stone Japanese Course Levels 1, 2, and 3 Pros: The Rosetta Stone approach to language learning is a new (and quite frankly, effective) one. Instead of learning vocabulary and grammar through repetitious rote memorization, Rosetta Stone utilizes the user's own deductive logic and inherent learning abilities to make the language fun and much easier to master. Each unit begins with the introduction of new sounds and words. You aren't expected to know what the words mean at this point, but you are encouraged to repeat them and listen to how you sound compared to native speakers. This is accomplished by using the included headset and microphone in conjunction with visual feedback of your voice. Next comes the vocabulary section. As I mentioned before, you are not given direct translations of the words; instead, you are shown a series of pictures that help you deduce the meanings of words and how they fit into the structure of the sentence. It becomes a sort of detective game, as you are given a sentence written entirely in the language, and using your brain, you come to instinctively pull it apart to find the meaning. After you find meaning to your words, the Phrases and Speaking sections help you put it into practice and solidify everything you learned in the unit. Add to that the included CDs full of audio lessons and samples of native speech, and you have a full package that turns an incredible task into an enjoyable experience. Cons: The only real con I could find with the software itself was the price. It may seem like a large price to pay for some CD-ROMS and a USB headset, but after using the product for awhile, I have come to see its true value. I have taken nearly a year and a half of college-grade Japanese, and I still have learned a great deal from the software. Also, the presentation of the material makes it fun enough for leisurely learners and youths.  So even though the price tag is a bit exorbitant, it beats the heck out of paying for 2 years of college language courses! Intended Users: This is where Rosetta Stone courses really shine. Not only did I have a go at the program, but I set up user profiles for my mother, father, sister and nephew in order to get a good cross-sectional view of how different ages and educations would react. All were positive. Perhaps the greatest surprise to me was my father, who is a very stern ""you can't teach an old dog new tricks"" kind of guy found himself getting caught up learning a language that he didn't even have a need for!

10443.0,660,1.0,"I am one of the people caught in TurboTax's removal of forms from their Deluxe version, so I bought this version of H&R Block tax software.

I then needed to trouble-shoot the numerous numbers that were different. Trouble-shooting in TurboTax was easy because most cells have either a magnifying glass to show the source of the number in that cell, or I can right-click and see the source of the number. Unfortunately most of the cells in H&R Block do not have any was of determining the source.  Wow, I couldn't believe that. I called the H&R Block customer service phone number and waited 35 minutes on hold, without knowing how many people were ahead of me. The representative I talked with didn't know how to show the source of numbers in cells, so she requested a supervisor. About ten minutes later the supervisor came onto the phone and told me there isn't any way to determine the specific source of the number. Only the general area of the interview process is sometimes known, but not any specific numbers or cells from other forms.  This leaves me with not being able to determine the reason for the difference in numbers between the two tax software. After using TurboTax for years, and being able to go back to the source, I can't imagine using H&R Block tax software in the future and not being able to question or trouble-shoot the numbers I see.

4222.0,280,5.0,"Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade was bought because the school needed Windows 7 Enterprise EQUIVALENT software. Seeing as how one $220 copy of Windows 7 was going to outdistance an $2000 a year at minimum Software Assurance contract, I bought this for a laptop that was at one time (but NOT now) the third most powerful Windows 7 machine in the house. The MacBook Pro went for a variety of reasons (mostly relating to overheating running multiple things it should have been OH SO EASILY capable of), but the eMachines W3622 I had gotten for Christmas obliged me by running Windows 7 with Aero, thus allowing me to accomplish a Windows 7 general availabilty long goal of having three Windows 7 running computers.  Now granted, the best Windows 7 machine is also a Mac, running Snow Leopard in addition to Windows 7 Ultimate, and due to needs to keep it running only runs Windows 7 Ultimate RTM-Lion and Mountain Lion would over-stress it, and that we cannot allow, thus meaning that we have to run the RTM Windows 7 on it, but this laptop has exceeded my expectations with Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 upgrade. Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 upgrade upgrades Windows Vista Home Premium SP1 or SP2 directly, but since we had been loaning out the laptop, we decided to do the clean install and do not regret it, except for some user error on my part (forgot to save something important mainly.)  I never had a problem with Windows Vista Home Premium, but Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate on machines that support Aero is really a treat, giving the user the ultimate in compatibility, capability, and flexibility. Windows 8 I keep hearing won't even begin to compare, the least of which reasons is when clicking on the Desktop tile you don't get the fine grained system control Windows 7 gives.  I always say I want my desktop OS choices to be the best they can be for the desktops, and the mobile OS choices best for and on my PDAs, smartphones, and tablets-unless I have enough extra money to buy a Windows 7 tablet, in which case I view it as an alternative option to a traditional clamshell laptop or netbook.  I want Windows 7, because Microsoft's marketing was proved true from my experiences with the release candidate all the way to fully updated Windows 7 RTM and SP1 today. Windows 8 seems like a giant step backwards, one which I do not appreciate.  5 stars, even with SP1. Without it it's 10 stars. (I happen to know what the RTM was like, and it was awesome.)  Update 1-17-2013: I will be updating all of the reviews for all of the Windows 7 installers I have on tap to reflect a certain difference betweem me and the average reviewer:  I to date have done all of my installs (whether of Ultimate Full Purchase Product, Ultimate Upgrade, Professional Upgrade through the Windows 7 Student Offer, Home Premium Upgrade, or Home Premium Upgrade Family Pack) through the clean install method and it never fails to grab all of the updates, update to SP1, and then grab the missing post-SP1 updates.  I therefore believe that the people who can't fully update Windows didn't do the clean install method, and while I don't blame them, I don't have the time personally for a system that behaves strangely because Windows Vista was trying to be transmuted into Windows 7, when it's hard enough for one service pack of Windows 7 to be successfully transmuted into another.  I hope that if you are blaming Windows 7 for your issues when upgrading from Vista, that this advice can be of use.  Update 2-3-2014:  Windows 7 is a good OS for those people who don't want a Mac but don't want Windows 8 either. It does do Classic appearance differently from Windows Vista and earlier, instead using the square buttons even in Classic appearance, but that's OK, because I dreamed of an OS with this functionality in the taskbar since Windows 95. And the redesigned taskbar is even in Windows 7 Home Premium. Sure you may lose some of the features in the Ultimate Edition, but you get everything you absolutely have to have-although Windows 7 Anytime Upgrade is no longer available to Windows 7 users, so buying the right edition of Windows 7 is extra-crucial. If you buy Windows 7 Home Premium and later find out you need XP Mode, you're going to have to sell your copy of Home Premium (assuming you're using the retail copy) and replace it with a retail copy of Ultimate or Professional.  Windows XP may have been great in 2001, but Windows 7 is as close to XP as you can make Vista-and has proven worthwhile ever since 2009.  For further proof, look at how Microsoft released Internet Explorer 10 and 11 for Windows 7, they sure didn't have to do that. But they realized Windows 7 was still popular (so popular I have 7 copies of it, including a Family Pack of Home Premium) and so they released as many of their updated components as they could for Windows 7 without totally making Windows 8/8.1 a non-issue.  End Update 2-3-2014  Update 2-27-2014:  As posted on my Windows 7 Ultimate Full Install and Windows 7 Professional Upgrade pages, I had a desktop with OEM Windows 7 Home Premium that I hedged my bets with by assigning it a dispensation from my Windows 7 Home Premium Family Pack, and up until a few days ago I didn't have legal Office to go along with the retail Windows 7 Upgrade install. So I was considering my options but the reviews on Windows 8, even from those who rated it highly, indicated that you might have issues and I didn't need issues, I needed software that would approach the ""just works"" of the Classic Mac OS. So I sat there, installed Office 2003 off of a spare copy I picked up, and then suddenly I was set. I had no reason to consider Windows 8 for this Windows 7 OEM PC any further, and so I set up the second 1TB hard drive to backup this copy of Windows 7 as well as Windows 7 Ultimate Full Install and Windows 7 Professional Upgrade and it went so smoothly. I am thrilled that I have a supported way out of the backup dilemma, compared to buying OEM Windows Home Server 2011 and losing use of the PC as a general-purpose desktop.  Needless to say, I got everything I wanted out of Windows 7 Ultimate (both copies) and Professional, and I'm happy.  End Update 2-27-2014  Update 9-16-2013 (Critical Windows 9 Status Update):  Well, consider what I uncovered about the supposedly awesome Windows 9, that's supposed to ""replace"" 7:  I also heard that Windows 9 may look like Windows 7, but this mini-start menu (based on a Microsoft press photo) has Live Tiles where links to local computer items once stood in 7. Plus Aero is still out for lunch (defenders say skeumorphism is dead, I say long live skeumorphism!), and Microsoft ties your activation to the Windows Store, so that means that they have a much more swift and sure means of sending your computer into reduced functionality mode even if you have a truly legal key!  I want my computer being rendered illegal for a good reason (at least not for something trivial like Windows 9 allows for), not because I didn't buy enough apps from the Windows Store in a given day, week, month, or year. How are you supposed to use the Metro-limited Windows 9 when not using Metro apps early and often could be grounds for your computer to be rendered illegal according to Microsoft? In effect, they've made Metro mandatory and inaccessible, rather than optional (from the ability to legally use Windows point of view, not from the it's in your face while you're using it point of view) and far too readily accessible?  I'd rather have a minor bug, as critical as the bug in question may be to the use of the computer, in the form of bad UI, than a horrible show-stopping bug that makes Windows 8's UI crimes (awful as they might have been) seem minor!  I love that they're bringing back the Start button, but what they really needed to do was scrap the Windows Store and modern apps. Not make your computer depend on them but be unable to use them because it's a desktop (known as Win32) SKU. I'm sticking with Windows 7 and as soon as it's toast no more Internet for me. I would suggest you do the same.  End Update 9-16-2014 (Critical Windows 9 Status Update)  Update 1-14-2015:  I am recently availing myself of the opportunity to tear Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade 64-bit with SP1 on hardware that was midrange for 2011 by complementing my Sandy Bridge desktop with a laptop, I have to say even with all of the Windows 8 features that were loaded into Windows 7 to make up for the fact that people didn't automatically do whatever it took to go to Windows 8, it still feels so much more like Windows 7 than Lion does (the equivalent Mac OS X version) when you install all the updates, and is a key reason why I gave up my Intel iMac for a newer if lower-end PC laptop, because I wanted to be able to update my OS and have it still feel like the stock version. Apple wouldn't give me that, so I went to Windows 7,  After I uninstalled a duplicate of an update that was part of Internet Explorer 11, Windows 7 installed and updated with the greatest of ease, and it provides me with a better experience than Lion or Yosemite on contemporary or newer Macs. Windows 7 may not have been perfect, but to me I couldn't tell the difference, and I'm using it on the best hardware I've ever used it on as proof.  Windows 7 you definitely should get the Ultimate Edition of it if you can, because it's better than Windows 8 Pro with Media Center, I find it's better than Windows 8.1 or Windows 8.1 Update 1, and due to a desire to turn Windows 9 into another Windows 8 style flop (but this time with a Live Tile-encrusted Start menu) is going to keep me on Windows 7 unless I go Mac, and like I said Lion and X.10 Yosemite have failed with Safari 6 and later, due to a huge combination of factors.  Get Windows 7 of Ultimate Edition and stick to it no matter what. I liked Windows 10 as of the Technical Preview Build 9879, but I so much won't like it as of RTM, and even as of the Technical Preview it would only be on a second hard disk opposite Windows 7, & only then if I could know I could readily go back and forth to Windows 7 for tasks I don't want to do on 8 and later, or especially Win 10 and later.

3506.0,223,5.0,"Three of the members of my family have been using this program for the past two - three weeks.  The first is myself, a 40 something who took Spanish in high school for 3 years, spent a summer in South America (and emerged fluent from that experience) but now am quite rusty.  I still understand a great deal of Spanish, but have lost my ability to speak it.  The second is my 12 year old son, who has had one year of fairly intensive Spanish over the previous school year.  The third is my 9 year old daughter, her previous Spanish only a few words gleaned from Dora the Explorer.  Both of my kids have to earn TV or video game time over the summer.  They  earn it by reading or playing educational computer games.  I offered this program as a choice when it arrived and both have chosen to do Rosetta Stone for about 80% of the overall required time.  Obviously they enjoy it, but would not chose it over playing on the video game console.   Both kids have been using the microphone.  I feel this is a strong point of the program since my kids really do not hear native speakers with the other Spanish Language Program we have (Eazyspeak Spanish ) .  The microphone option has several choices for how closely you have to match the correct pronunciation in order to ""pass"".  I have it adjusted higher for my son and lower for my daughter.  I also had to adjust the speaker volume from the control panel of the computer (use Start- Control Panel - Sounds and Audio Devices).  For the 12 year old with one year of Spanish, starting about halfway though level one was appropriate.  For myself Level 1 was too easy.  At level 2 I found that I was ""relearning"" some things (especially matching noun and verb type) that I had forgotten.  The program is visually pleasant,  good quality photos, and a good mix of types of teaching such as listening to a phrase and picking the correct photo,  repeating phrases,  having to come up with your own phrases to describe the photos,  typing answers.  I find the audio companion very useful, it is helping me drag the forgotten Spanish out of my brain.  The kids do not like it at all,  I think the lack of visual feedback is frustrating for them but it could also be that they prefer the ""books on cd"" we usually listen to when traveling in the car.  My son had been using ""Eazyspeak Spanish"" before Rosetta stone.  This is also a good program for learning basic vocabulary (if you just want to go to Mexico and be able to ask for the bathroom, or chose menu items) but it does not give you any feedback about your pronunciation.  Be aware, the Eazyspeak  program does teach all sorts of names for alcoholic drinks and has some innuendos.  Rosetta Stone is a great way to learn basic Spanish, much closer to how you ""naturally"" learn. However, I do not thing you will be ""fluent"" after finishing the program, but you will be able to get your basic messages across and navigate more easily when on vacation.  It is fantastic as a supplement to a beginning Spanish classes and a great way for kids to start learning another language.  I plan on having my daughter finish all the lessons before she starts taking Spanish in school, it should give her a good solid foundation.  ***UPDATE  My son went back to school 3 weeks ago.  I got an email from his teacher this week saying that my son had really improved his pronunciation over the summer and had remembered more of his vocabulary than the rest of the class.  He asked me if what we did with him over the summer and I told him that my son had done Eazy Speak Spanish for a month and then Rosetta Stone.  **One year update   We are still using this software on a weekly basis.  During the summer I have my teenage son (who is taking Spanish in school) use Rosetta Stone.  It is very helpful in retaining vocabulary.  My 10 year old daughter has been working her way through the program as well,  she should start out her first Spanish class with a good grasp of some of the basics.  They enjoy the program, so it does not take much pushing to get them to use it.",770

Old review below. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ Let start by saying I am an old time user of CorelDraw.  I used it for years at my job and loved it.  The Suite X8 offers much more and still has the feel and performance I remember.  I am also a Adobe Photoshop user.  I ended up moving more into using Photoshop mainly due to more local classes and support compared to CorelDraw, though Corel was/is my favorite.  If you are looking at this Suite I'm sure it is because you know what you need for your job.  I don't see the hobby types using or buying this based on the cost.  Installation was painless and flawless.  I guess we would hope so for this price range of product.  Once installed I find everything seems to work well.  I would like to give a more detailed review, however I am unable with the amount of time given me to complete this.  You see, I received this from Amazon Vine to review and I received this package for the cost of the taxes on the product.  I will make a good attempt to update this review as I have more time to explore and use it.  All in all if you need a graphics program for work, this is an excellent suite package and offers more for the money than my Adobe package other than local training.  Other than the frequent crashing of the program, it would be great.",1813

7181.0,478,3.0,"This software works with Mac or Windows or iOS devices and can be used by 5 users or 5 devices. It protects your logins and passwords by creating a secure private connection. Very important for those who conduct business in coffee shops, and regularly log on to secure sites in public. It accomplishes this task by creating a VPN and encrypting your connection and making it invisible on public networks, so spy software will not be able to track it. According to product literature it also protects you during app usage on your iOS devices. Of course, you can also use it at home for better encryption.  Although Norton says that it will not cause any slowdown in the bandwidth, I keep experiencing delays, especially on public networks. It's hard to tell what's causing it though as the public networks are public and there are multiple users logged on at any time. The software also starts automatically on Mac and Windows. For iOS you will have to turn on VPN protection in settings. Then go into Norton settings to make the privacy protection manual. That will allow you to manually enable VPN protection when you are on a public network, otherwise you will experience slow speeds on secure networks.  It's good to use some sort of privacy when logged on to public networks, but given the slow down I won't use it if I am just watching youtube or casual websurfing. I am already careful never to enter email passwords or bank passwords when I am on public WiFi and use my cellular network. So given the high cost of this product it has limited use for me.",783

It's full featured... a nice menu system, resizing for the screen, and the normal control buttons (stop, pause, play, etc.). The nicest feature of the player is the ""Work Along"" mode. In this mode, the video plays in a small window while you're working in Lightroom. This lets you try the commands along with the video.  Video and audio quality is excellent. The 2 instructors do a great job. They don't get over technical and keep a good pace.

6917.0,456,5.0,"What? Nobody thinks this review is helpful?  I really don't understand why. Just because I actually like Windows 8?  Like a lot of people, it was very frustrating at first to know how to do anything until I discovered this was just a shell built over Windows 7.  In fact, you can escape the top layer shell with a single click.  What I really like most is the Netflix App (the trendy name now).  So easy to watch multi-chapter movies now.  Boot up is astonishingly fast - less than 15 seconds with an old Intel 80 GB SSD from a full power off state with a low cost HP desktop computer with an AMD processor.  I've never witnessed anything like this speed previously, probably three times faster than Windows 7.  I have multiple other computers in my house, but the one I have dedicated to my HDTV was well worth upgrading to Windows 8.  I am not in a rush to upgrade the others yet, especially since I know it is still Windows 7 under the outer shell.  But am I glad I upgraded the computer that is my connection to my television and the internet.  I only paid $15 directly to Microsoft for the upgrade.  But I got too cautious and didn't buy any more upgrades because I didn't like it at first.  It takes a week or so to get the hang of these boxes across your screen.  I wish they allowed the old familiar icons instead of the boxes.  Now it is just boxes and text inside - not very appealing.  Seems retro to the 1980s, not a leap forward.  But it still works.  You have to do a Google search to learn how to do anything even basic.  This is a start over as far as the outer shell is concerned.  But you can easily drop down below the outer shell and you are right back to the Windows 7 look and feel.  Well, the Control Panel is really different.  I don't much like the new way either, but it is still there more or less.  I think they are copying the Apple Tablet style where there are zillions of individuals creating Apps and charging money.  I am not one to pay for the apps.  So far I can find all the things I want for free.  Other than the fast boot speed and the all the boxes on your monitor, it is still pretty much like Windows 7 underneath.  One minor annoyance.  You have to pay $10 to get the Windows Media Player that was free in Windows 7.  You can't play a DVD without it.  Well, you can - just not so easy.  You'll end up buying like did, but you won't like paying for it.  It is like Outlook used to come with Microsoft Office.  Then they split it off and charged the same price for Outlook as the entire Microsoft Office package cost.  Essentially they doubled the price if you really wanted Outlook.  Gripes me.

6623.0,438,4.0,"For most common and basic uses, I think the Quicken WillMaker software is a good solution for those that want to ""do it themselves"" for their wills and other estate needs, but I would caution that if your needs are NOT basic and/or if you aren't following most common and typical practices, you may find this software is too rigid and not able to satisfy your needs, in which case you'd be left turning towards paying a professional or going with online solutions.  If you approach the use of this software with that caveat in mind, then I think you'd be fine, though it should be noted that the quality of this software also depends entirely on the quality of the patches and updates that are distributed by the manufacturer.  If they break something while trying to fix or provided enhancements elsewhere in the product, then you may wish you hadn't updated at all and instead used earlier versions of the product that perhaps more directly fit your own needs.  On the plus side, the product isn't too expensive (at least not typically) and older versions are normally reduced in price as newer ones are released so you can find an earlier revision at a bargain price if you shop around a bit.  If you are reading this review and wish that I'd say more about how easy it is to use the product, or about features that I liked and disliked, I didn't want to use the space here for that because I don't see the use of this software as something that I'd be going about doing constantly.  This is a once a year chore, if that.  Facing one's own mortality or thinking about what is going to happen with an estate after you are gone isn't something most humans worry about, rather we all tend to try to ignore the fact that we're all going to be leaving this world eventually.  If the software is usable, then I'm happy, and this software is normally just that.  I may have to adopt my thinking a bit to the way this software has organized the process, but it still winds up being easy enough to get through.  If it was truly horrible, then of course I'd note that and offer the big ""AVOID!!!"" warning, but that isn't the case here.  For do-it-yourself will and estate handling, WillMaker Plus 2013 should be fine.  Again, those that need more customization or have more complex cases to deal with are best advised to work with a professional.

I can usually remember that the 12"" is called ""large"", but I can never remember if it's the 14"" or the 16"" that is ""huge"" or if the 26"" is ""enormous"" or ""gigantic"".  In the end, I just say either ""your second smallest"" or ""the 14-inch one"" because that makes much more sense and I'm certain to get what I'm expecting.  Software companies often do the same thing.  In this case the most stripped down version is known as ""Deluxe"".  ""Deluxe"" is defined to mean ""luxurious or sumptuous; of a superior kind"" and yet that's the exact opposite of what you get when you buy the ""Deluxe"" product (just like when you buy a ""large"" pizza, you are really getting the exact opposite--a small pizza).  The next version up is ""Ultra"" (that's the one I have) which means ""extreme"", ""at the edge"", or even ""beyond"", when in fact it is a mid-level product.  Then you have ""Ultimate"", ""Ultimate Suite"", and finally ""Director Suite"".  Having this many versions is bad enough, but the naming is downright confusing and drives me nuts... to the point that I'm going to have to remove a star.  Sorry guys.  Now cut it out.  <pauses for a breath... trying to find a happy place... sigh...>  As for the software itself, I have used PowerDirector 12 for a while now and have appreciated it's user interface and feature set.  A year or two ago, I was working on what appeared to be a very simple project--I imported a movie I had gotten online (legally downloaded, I'll have you know) and was trying to edit it for time so a co-worker could use it in a presentation.  The effects were all very simple: fade in/fade out, etc. but even though I spent a couple of hours with various video editing programs, I could not get it to work for me.  As I recall, Adobe Premier Pro CS5 couldn't understand the input file format so first I converted it with an AVS4You program.  Then I had it all edited the way I wanted, but Premier had a zillion and fifty output format settings and I couldn't seem to find the magical combination that would work on my co-worker's Mac and still be a reasonable size (either the file was HUGE, the quality was TERRIBLE, or it just wouldn't work on the Mac).  Next I switched to Pinnacle Studio 14, but it had issues, too--I don't remember what they were, but it was obvious that Pinnacle was a no-go.  Finally I tried PowerDirector.  It was more or less the first time I had used the program, and yet in under an hour, I had a fully rendered video that was a good quality, reasonable file size AND it played on my Windows PC and my co-worker's Mac.  As a side note, I'm pretty sure that Premier Pro can do all the things I've used PowerDirector for, but the darn program has such a learning curve that I often spend a good deal of time just trying to figure out how to do something as simple as fading from one clip to another.  Oh, sure--once you know how to do it, it's easy and once you have been working with the program for a long time, you'll probably find features much faster, but for a novice like myself, it's usually just a frustration.  PowerDirector, on the other hand, has an interface that to me is very intuitive.  You can go to Cyberlink's web site to view all the new features in 13 from 12, but in my opinion, the most noteworthy change is the addition of 2 new formats, XAVC-S and H.265/HEVC.  As noted previously, I'm no video editing expert and I don't use these programs often, but from what I can tell, the look and feel has not changed in any significant way.  If you are reading reviews trying to figure out which video editing program you want to get, I would highly recommend one of the flavors of PowerDirector.  Just go to the web site first so you know what it is you are getting (and what you are not) with the version you pick--the name sure as heck ain't gonna' tell ya!",106

10009.0,630,5.0,"Cyberlink PowerDirector 13 Ultimate is an extremely powerful tool for editing and transforming videos. It has plenty of features and bells and whistles, which most novice and even medium-level movie makers may not need or even want to take advantage of. I only say this because Cyberlink Power Director 13 has several different versions, and customers should research which features they may need for their own level of expertise.  This version, Ultimate, comes with 10GB of cloud storage, as does their Ultra version, which is considerably less expensive. Ultimate, like the Ultimate Suite, does include Premium Effects and Templates, which are not available in the less-expensive, Ultra version (the premium effects do include a wedding template package as well as a vacation video template package).  Any of these PowerDirector 13 versions is going to give you an outstanding tool for transforming your videos with titles and special effects. However, if you are not familiar with this product, be prepared for a learning curve and give yourself adequate time to learn how to use it to its full advantage. All of their versions provide great support for automatic uploading to YouTube, Facebook, and other on-line video sharing sites, as well as support for creating your own DVDs, including Blu-ray and the new 4K Ultra HD.  Cyberlink does offer a free trial download of PowerDirector 13 on their website which does not have all the features of Ultra, Ultimate, or Ultimate Suite, but will give you a chance to experience the core product before buying.

8079.0,533,4.0,"When I started typing, we had manual typewriters (clickity clack and ting for the return). Electric typewriters were available but not at our high school. By the time I went to college, I had an electric typewriter and actually charged $1 per page to type papers for fellow students. Although at that time, it was not particularly lucrative, it was the practice that became invaluable to me.  As a business owner now, I can't tell you how much time I save in having good typing skills. I try to tell my kids that they will never regret being a good typist. They still don't get it but hopefully... So the point is, to be a good typist, you have to practice and you have to practice by using good technique as well or breaking the bad habits will be almost impossible. For example, although I can type at about 70 words per minute, I still only use one of the shift keys no matter what hand I need the capital letter. Oh well.  What this all means is that you need to have a way to practice in a methodical manner. Mavis Beacon does a good job of going through the keys in the method and order I remember back in high school. There are plenty of ways to practice and then test yourself as well. Each person has a profile to keep track of your own progress. The lessons can also be read out loud and there are instructional videos as well. It is a little hokey at times but it gets the point across. It is not super fun so that kids have games and things to play if they are trying it but I actually think it is perfect for young teens or adults learning to type for the first time. Or, if you want to hone your skills. It is frustrating that you cannot backspace to correct when typing but I believe that is how the high school tests are done as well, and that is the best way of calculating your ability to type error free.  My kids (one has done it and one will be in a few years) have to pass a typing test in high school as part of the curriculum. This is a great way to get them to be more prepared.",1083

1306.0,84,5.0,"10.5 upgraded from 10.4 like a dream.  No difficulties at all on a Powerbook G4.  Time Machine has been a fantastic feature to have, painlessly backing up data for me in the background and saving me the trouble of doing so manually.  Typically it does so with no additional drag on the responsiveness of the computer (which is several years old, and I tend to run a lot of programs at a time) though occasionally if I've left it unhooked from the external drive for an extended period and it has a lot to sort through the responsiveness will slow for a minute or two while it catches up.  Spaces is a great feature as well, allowing you to divide your windows up among multiple 'virtual' desktops.  On this particular computer I find that I don't use it a great deal, because I don't find that a laptop lends itself to this style of use for me.  However, I've used similar features from Linux distributions on a desktop to know that in that situation it's a great help to keeping things organized and moving along.  If you're happy with Tiger (10.4) and already have a solid backup arrangement I wouldn't necessarily say that you must rush to update as quickly as possible.

3163.0,184,1.0,"If it were possible to give Vista a negative rating I would do so.  Vista is unlike every other Microsoft Operating System ever produced.  Every new Microsoft Operating System came with its annoying little bugs.  Those of us who liked Microsoft Windows myself among them usually got used to living with the MS bugs or ""Features"" as they are called by the company.  Vista was inflicted on PC users because somewhere Microsoft got the notion that a more complex difficult to use memory hogging buggy wizard filled operating system was more secure thus much better.  Vista is indeed far more secure than any earlier Microsoft product for one basic reason it never lets you do anything.  You can not be productive on Vista unless you jump through more operating system generated hoops than you will ever see during a lifetime at the circus.  Don't get me wrong.  I am not one of these geeky guys that wants everyone to switch to Linux or Apple.  I love my Microsoft Windows XP PC but, Microsoft Vista is a gigantic LEMMON no amount of Service Pack tweaking will ever fix.  I have XP systems and I will be keeping my XP computer.  If I buy a new computer with Pretty but way lame Vista pre-installed I will reformat my disk and install my trusty capable XP operating system workhorse.  To say Vista is super slow at start up, during regular use and at shut down is an understatement in its most profound incarnation.  If you buy a system with so much memory, new graphics, sound and other high priced, hogh powered hardware producing a system that costs a kings ransom Vista will speed up a little.  Vista is a money hog because many old XP devices do not work on Vista at all and others need lots of tweeking to get them to work.  Now Vista is so improved it will never crash, naw Vista just freezes up so completely you can not do anything productive.  Vista will make you more productive because all its freeze up's will have you doing the same work again and again and again and again hoping it won't freeze before you can save it!  Finally Vista is a big useless paranoid fat nag.  I mean at every turn Vista wants to reformat, check or otherwise make sure something you are doing is allowed.  Vista is the Fort Knox of Operating Systems but think about it who wants to live and work in Fort Knox.  Vista is an operating system as such it is an extention of your home or business.  Adding Vista to your computer is like stationing thousands of nagging police officers whose job it is to challenge your every move every time you become even the least bit productive.  Vista is an operating system with so many paranoid subsystems built in that it is effectively useless for its intended productive purpose.  For all the reasons I list herein I would strongly advise against purchasing Vista.  I feel Vista is the prettiest operating system Microsoft has ever produced but under that pretty surface is a code full of maggots that grow into extremely pretty productivity killing computer bugs.",573

5103.0,342,5.0,"SKETCHBOOK PRO 2011 contains DVD two discs that can be used on either a Windows or Mac based computer. You do need a DVD drive to use it (three of our home computers don't have a DVD drive). You also need a mouse, that's all you need.  This is a fun program in which you manipulate the mouse to make art. Since I own and use Adobe Photoshop Elements 7 I note some of the controls are quite similar such as selecting the tool and opacity and working with layers.  To start, you just click on the type of medium you want to use (i.e. marker, pencil, paintbrush) then select the thickness, color, and opacity and you are off and running. The menu bar is in the corner and you can expand some of them if you find that easier.  I started fooling around with this without directions, since none came in a paper form and I'm a book person. However there are tutorial documents on the disc to help you. On a whim I used an internet search engine and found video tutorials from the manufacturer on YouTube. These helped me the most.  I am an amateur artist and enjoy this program. I let my kids test it out, they are aged 10 and 13 and both found it simple. They used the tools intuitively and found more features than I realized existed. They really liked the split screen mirror image tool and the one that repeats in the four quadrants what you do on the screen (imagine drawing with one line but seeing an image like a kaleidoscope).  Since I am new to making digital art, I realize there's a learning curve. While I can control a regular drawing pencil in my hand to sketch on paper, it's a completely different skill to use the mouse to replicate the same thing. It's an odd feeling to try to do something you know you can do with pencil and paper but struggle to make a smooth or straight line with the mouse as the tool. In the beginning it feels like a trick on the mind to use a mouse and see the medium you usually associate with a regular marker, paintbrush, or pencil making magic on the screen.  I have no compaints about this product.  As with any computer program or with any traditional art medium, what you get out of it depends both on what you want to do with it (translating your concept to reality) and also how much time you put into learning the skills, procedures and techniques necessary to get it to do what you want it to do.

Installation on the various computers was fast and it seems to have minimal impact on the overall system operation...right now, I'm running a deep system scan while writing this review. The Task Manager shows that Norton's CPU utilization is being held to about 6% and the memory footprint is under 100MB...those numbers obviously increase when I stop typing and the scheduler allocates more resources to Norton.  Bottom line, though, is that usability of my system isn't impacted by the scan.  Since being installed, Norton has flagged multiple suspect emails, a couple of web sites and a downloaded .msi file.  The .msi file was flagged based on Norton's ""reputation"" algorithm, as opposed to actually analyzing the file.  Since it was a purchased program from Elcomsoft, a leading forensics software vendor, that was a bit annoying...especially since it immediately erased the file. I had to temporarily disable Norton to get it installed.  Subsequent deep system scans haven't detected any issues with my system.  My Recommendation: The cost per seat is reasonable.  It does the job that it's intended to do.  It has minimal impact on system resources.

3823.0,247,3.0,"I've been a Streets & Trips user since the program was introduced.    It has never been tops in its class, but it was superior to similarly priced products like Delorme's.    With S&T 2009, however, Microsoft falls behind the curve in terms of user interface, map accuracy, technology and, importantly, customer care.    The customer care aspect is perhaps the most important. S&T is great for trip planning. However, Microsoft now restricts installation to two computers, which was not the case with earlier versions. Likewise, there is no option to deactivate the program, a la Adobe, prior to installing on another computer. As far as I can determine, once you install it on two computers, you're stuck unless you call Microsoft's Asian-based customer service and manage to beg another registration code, such as when you replace one of the computers.    This is simply a bad business model, in my opinion.    Next, the maps are increasingly outdated. I checked the restaurants around my home and they are at least three years or more out of date. From reading Amazon reviews, I picked up some roads in the Chicago area that others claimed weren't on the map, though they have been in place for a long time. The critics are right: even a major expressway extension that was completed several years ago isn't on the maps.    Sure, Microsoft licenses the maps from a cartographic compiler, but you'd think they'd exercise more quality control on behalf of their customers and demand more up-to-date maps.    Nope.    Finally, on my list of major deficiencies, is the interface. It really isn't much different than prior years and is simply growing stale. Three keystrokes to update the route directions from the GPS is too much.    Overall, S&T 2009 is as good as it ever was - and that's the problem: it isn't changing much from past versions and it does not help that the maps are so outdated. The clumsy attempt to force the user to purchase a copy for every computer they might run it on is ridiculous: the basic license should cover at least two computers. Even Adobe is that liberal.

If you're a parent and your goal is to just very simply create some nice looking home movies to burn on DVD and distribute to other family members or even upload directly to Youtube (which is a very nice feature), then Ulead Video Studio is looking like the best program out there for doing so. It's also, by far, the easiest to use and understand while not forfeiting presentation quality and features doing so. The learning curve on this is very fast and dedicating a mere ten minutes to the manual will yield pretty impressive results.  Some folks might think that you'll have to invest thousands of dollars on a new Mac so you can have a new version of iLife and do all this without having an intimate knowledge of video editing or processing, but this really is a much better and a much cheaper alternative. While buying a Mac is always a cool prospect, you may not have to do that just yet.  The only drawback I could find was in using the built-in `Movie Wizard' which is a bit restrictive, even though it's `drag and drop'. Creating movies this way, renders your footage faster and gives you a much grainer, or lower resolution end result. If you can avoid using this feature, I would, as having the ability to fully control the output settings is an absolute must.",891
10070.0,635,3.0,"This has already been pretty thoroughly reviewed, so I'll just throw in my two cents... The VHStoDVD 8.0 Deluxe package seems to be what it advertises, but with varying levels of success. The wizard does do the job, as long as you follow all the on-screen directions, but since you are going from a lossy 480i source to a digital screen that is more than likely 720p or higher, you will notice lots of junk in the video that you didn't see back when you last watched it on a tube television in 1996. That's to be expected.  But it does do the trick for accepting the video input. However, the disc burning is a bit lackluster. On two attempts I got coasters instead of playable discs, and I have a newer system with a nice optical drive. I recommend having a backup app, like Nero, a Cyberlink product, or TinyBurner to do the actual disc burning. You may find it more successful, though a bit less simple.  I haven't tried this yet, but from what I've researched this device and application will even copy VHS tapes protected by Macrovision, which means you can most likely back up your old Disney videos that have been put in the ""Disney Vault"". -- I unfortunately don't have any commercial VHS tapes left to test this on, but I've read up on it and it seems that others have had success with this product for that purpose. Of course, your experience may vary.  While I'm not fond of transferring VHS to DVD (awful quality either way; The fault of the cruddy old VHS format) I find this very useful for connecting my turntable and recording my vinyl albums, which is also supported in the software.  All in all it's a good product with a few bumps in the road. The hardware is solid. The software is sometimes finicky. I give it three stars (this is ""average"" in my rating system).. It doesn't excel at what it does, but it's not a bad product either. It works well enough to deserve a look, but might require a little tweaking and possibly another product to get exactly the end product you desire.",542

But understand, I cannot prove that the program actually works.  For sure, its not perfect.  For one thing, when I analyze a disk before erasing deleted data, its result is over-printed on the text and cannot be read.  This is clearly a glitch in the program.  It existed in the first copy I installed, and it exists in the new copy I installed after removing the first - even after downloading the newest version.  This glitch of course, could be caused by my own computer or other software corrupting the program.  I just don't have the computer knowledge to know one way or the other.

Summary:  Kaspersky ""total"" allowed vicious malware from Filezilla, an FTP program that now contains malware which prevents you from using Google!  I spent over an hour online with 3 different support people, and the last one said it would take 24-48 hours to fix it!  Internet research shows this problem has been around for 3 months  Details:  I was setting up a brand new machine from Dell.  In the first day, when I installed FileZilla, from FileZillas site, it puts this evil malware called Vosteran on your machine that takes over as a search engine.  Even if you go into Chrome to remove it, it adds itself back in.  Vosteran is evil, and FIlezilla sold out in Sept of 2014, as Wikipedia shows.  Simple problem, and 3 months old, but Kaspersky didn't stop it.  Even after creating an account at Kaspersky, you cant make comments on their web page (find out later you needed to verify by email, but they don't tell you that up front).  Called Kaspersky, and the woman spoke softly and couldn't understand me due to her accent, so I asked to speak to someone else. She wouldnt let me speak to someone else!  She couldn't fix the problem, and said shed send me an email about how to fix the problem, because for some reason, they don't put the solution online.  Of course, they also allowed the malware onto my machine.  The next person told me that there would be an additional charge if their technical support had to solve the problem (that they originally caused because their Total security didn't stop the malware).  Amazing.  The email didn't arrive, and she hung up on me.  The next guy didn't speak English well either, and said he sent me an email.  By this point, Id gotten about 8 emails from Kaspersky, from their forums that I tried to sign up for which were sending verification emails, which they never said they were sending, which was the reason that they didn't let me make comments, and finally, one from the previous woman, which came about 15 minutes late).  The 2nd guy escalates to a 3rd woman, who says I have to run a program, send them a log file, and then wait 24-48 hours to get a response.

1043.0,78,5.0,"Alright. I had paid $79 for iWork '09 because it was having some staying power as the current version, and so on a whim I thought I would go and see what 2008 vintage Macintosh computing would be like, using my iMac 2.8GHz that I reviewed under iMac MB325LL/A. So since the iMac came with a Summer 2008 version of Leopard and iLife '08, I thought I would give iWork '08 a whirl since the iMac was overheating running the '09 versions of iWork and iLife and Leopard 10.5.8, not to mention Snow Leopard or Lion, or especially Mountain Lion.  Well, Pages and Numbers are lacking in features and the presentation of all three of them isn't quite as polished, but one little thing that really bugged me about the newer version of iWork, specifically Keynote '09 (some ""builds"" were only available as building in, while others were only available building out), was not the case on my copy of iWork '08. Other people's copies may be different, but iWork '08 proved that sometimes the grass is greener on the other side, even if it often isn't.  Seeing as how I love Keynote (always been fascinated by presentation programs, in fact I went to great efforts to take Microsoft Office for Mac 4.2.1 off of a Workgroup Server 6150 and put it on our primary family computer of the time, a Performa 6116CD to show you how much I loved presentation software) this was a delightful surprise making iWork '08 worth what I paid for it, which was $20 plus insignificant shipping, and it may find permanent use when I permanently semi-retire the iMac, which isn't totally through with school tasks yet, just taking a school task break to help increase it's longevity as much as possible.  So in the end, for what iWork '09 really let me down on but iWork '08 succeeded on, it's every bit as 5-starred as iWork '09, because I have Microsoft Office:mac 2008 Home and Student and 2 copies of Office 2007 I can rely on for more advanced stuff.  I love iWork, once it got a spreadsheet app, which means iWork '08 or later. iWork before Numbers had too gaping a hole in my opinion.",435

Buried three menu levels deep is a list of files that it excludes by default from even a disk image backup.

If Acronis is not actually making a true disk image, what else is it hiding from me? Also, I had to type my encryption password four times during a test restore before it was recognized. Maybe I mis-typed it the first time, but not twice after that. Having done more than a few restores from backup in the past 35 years, I have to have absolute trust in the backup software I use. Acronis falls far short of earning that trust.  To add insult to injury, half of the main menu features are attempts to sell cloud backup space and backup for phones and other devices. I want no nonsense backup software, not shill-ware. Finally, despite thousands of words in English in the interface, the main menu is a set of cryptic icons with no text.

5541.0,371,4.0,"OmniPage has for years been the standard when it comes to OCR software. While there are other good OCR software solutions out there, OmniPage has consistently been considered the best. I was excited about the opportunity to work with it any while it is good software I found it to be a little ornery and quirky on occasion.  Installation was not smooth on my system. When I inserted the DVD, the installer promptly updated several support application layers such as .NET 4.0 and Microsoft's XML services layer. It was nice to see all of these things installing sequentially, but I was given no option at all about whether or not I wanted them installed, even though some of these were already installed on my system. Once it reached the actual installation for OmniPage itself, though, the installer completely hung. I was unable to eject the DVD and I finally was forced to do a hard shutdown and power-on just to get my system usable again, after which the installer allowed OmniPage to install without argument. I am not sure what happened that caused the installer hang and I was unable to reproduce it.  I launched OmniPage without an active internet connection and during the start-up it asked to be activated via the internet. Also, 4 browser windows opened.  Once through the start-up OmniPage was ready to work. I selected a PDF file for processing and was given several options for translation so I selected MS Word format and let it go. It took quite a bit of time to process, and it prompted me frequently on spelling suggestions (this PDF was a laptop disassembly manual so it flagged multiple technical terms and abbreviations - my fault). I rejected all changes and let it finish. While it worked I was able to change the view to get a workflow view as well as an overview of the resulting document. The multiple views provided an interesting look at various states of my document.  Once the corrections were all through it offered to save the document and I selected a name and saved it, and the result was an empty file. I suspect the problem was that it opened the file for writing but really was not done with the conversion when the output file was created. This is a good thing to keep in mind - patience is required while conversion is running.  The software came with no printed manuals at all, just the DVD.  OmniPage is powerful software and it's really straightforward to use. It has some good features and it simplifies the process of translating image files to text.

107.0,8,4.0,"Before ordering this product directly from Amazon, I did my homework by posting comments in the comments sections of the most popular Amazon reviewers who have purchased and reviewed this product and other popular Spanish learning software.  After doing my homework, I finally decided to invest in this product.  Many people complain about the teaching method of this software but I think the problem is that many people are comparing this economically priced software with foreign language learning software that costs several hundred dollars.  If the price of this software were several hundred dollars, I would have probably only given it 1 star. But this software does not cost several hundred dollars and happens to be one of the most economically priced software programs available for learning a foreign language. At the very least, this software will teach you how to say and recognize a few hundred words. For that reason, I must give this software at least 4 stars.  Without a doubt, what I like most about this program is that it has lots of Spanish lessons at a very good price. The first level consists of 2 CDs that cover a lot of basic words and phrases that are helpful to know. And the second level also has 2 CDs that build on the words and phrases covered in Level 1 by giving the learner the tools to put together increasingly more complex sentences while ensuring that you are also learning proper pronunciation.  I found that the second level taught enough so that at the completion of the second level, the student should be able to string together basic phrase or sentences in order to converse about members of the family, sports, etc.  The third level which consisted of two CDs as well was my favorite level because it was the most challenging which is ideal for me because  I have been studying Spanish for quite a while. The actual conversations in the third level were a lot more challenging for me than the single vocabulary words covered in level 1 and the basic phrases covered in level 2. The third level also helped to reinforce what I learned in the other lessons.  There is a bonus CD with a game that comes with Immersion Spanish called Oscar On The Lake which I did not find fun at all.  I could have easily done without the Oscar On The Lake game. In fact, I don't see what was the point in including this Oscar On The Lake game with the program.  But I did find that the audio CD was very helpful. The audio CD thoroughly covered the alphabet, greetings, pronouns (including vosotros) conjugating AR, ER, and IR verbs, weather, numbers, and vocabulary for shopping and at the post office. What I liked most about the audio CD is that the instructor gave a lot grammatical explanations  including when the ""vos"" (as opposed to ""vosotros"") is used instead of the ""tu"" form. One of the bonuses that I received with my Immersion Spanish software was in interactive DVD with Spanish learning games for the whole family. The DVD is can be used on the TV.  But I haven't had a chance to use the DVD because the 3 Levels consisting of 6 CDs and the audio CD, have enough to keep me busy for a quite a while.  One feature about Immersion Spanish the appeals to me is that the software can be used by both children and adults who want to learn Spanish.  Based on the product's price and the content, I recommend it.  Some other products that I recommend for Spanish language learners are Visual Link Spanish.

But after using Visual Link, it is clear to me that this software is a much better alternative for the visual learner.

To speak Spanish fluently besides having a stand alone course as your base and a method to learn new Spanish words, you will also need to master conjugating Spanish verbs. The best product for that is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verbarrator-Version-1-1-Windows-Version/dp/B002EADP1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)</a>&nbsp;software.

The amount of export options has to be a big plus, and it includes the ability to easily format any video file or project for any of your mobile devices including your iPod, iPhone, Zune, PSP, etc.  That's a huge thing that many people are looking for.  Some of the newer options like HD and BlueRay authoring aren't going to get wide use immediately, but they are must-haves for the growing HD crowd out there.  Within Video Studio there are a few basic options.  The Movie Wizard is a quick and dirty import and export tool.  This is the easiest option to choose to convert, trim and condense video files.  There's also a bunch of templates included for standard transitions to add some openings, endings, fades and credits.  Once again, even with the Wizard alone you can really clean up some video files fast.  You can even import them directly from you digital recorder, but I opt to save my files and import them afterwords.  I always like to have a backup seperate from what I'm working on, so this makes it easier for me to keep track of my import and export areas.  In the full blown Video Studio tool you can open up video and audio files and add them to a project.  The benefit of that is that you can merge and splice your files and add custom transitions and graphics to really make your videos pop.  Once again, there's a lot of features here.  You really have to spend some time playing and exploring.  Media One is kind of an extra, but it makes it easy to do some basic graphics and picture stuff to add to your videos.  Another extra is Intermedia DVD player, which is included on many OEM system software packages but didn't come with my box.  So that's a nice extra too.  One positive thing is that there are a bunch of tutorials and help file documentats included on your extras disks.  There's also plenty of clips to play with and test your skills on.  If you haven't done video editing before that's probably the best place to start.  Still, I think this program is user friendly enough to do basic things like import / export and conversions out of the box.  Since most people will want to start by collecting all their videos, that's a nice plus in terms of the usability.  One con I have to note is that converting videos to certain formats seems to use pre-set frame rates that take some time to customize.  And it seems to convert some of these formats frame by frame, instead of using much faster file conversion techniques.

While there are more basic versions of the software that are closer in price to this guy, I find that the Corel Ulead software is more stable overall.  Don't get me wrong, the Movie-box ultimate package is a great value because it includes the hardware interface.  If you don't have all the connectors you need, that might be a good alternative.  But if you just compare software to software, Corel Ulead stacks up well against Pinnacle Studio Ultimate.  Truth be told, for this price I have to forgive the other minor cons I noted.  That includes mainly that the menu and icon graphics aren't the snazziest.  Still, compared to Apple's Built-in editor and Windows built-in movie editor (from Vista Ultimate) this guy includes more formats and features right out of the box.  And once again, for what you get this is really a great value in software.  Definitely check this out.  The Corel site has some clips and information to get you more used to the kinds of things you can produce.  Enjoy!!!",55
6719.0,441,4.0,"This review is for the Home & Business version, which except for the business feature is essentially the same as the Premier version and not that different from the Basic version.  There is an unusually high percentage of negative review on this product, hopefully what I can offer may help:  1. Having owned every version of Quicken (I bought Ver. 1 on a 5.25"" DOS floppy directly from the originator), I have quite a bit of experience with the product.  The early generations were essentially a form-filler for printing checks on your dot matrix printer and keeping track of your checkbook register.  The latest versions try to do much more.  2. My copy of 2013 installed without a hitch.  Unlike previous versions it does NOT let you do a fresh install if it senses that there is a previous version on your computer, and it does NOT let you pick which backup file you would like restored.  I consider this a negative.  On a positive note on this subject, it DOES restore all user preferences ... older versions would always make you reset such things as what the ""enter"" key does and basic printer settings.  3. Sigh, there is precious little to justify spending up to $100 on a ""new"" version.  It looks, acts and works virtually identical to last year's version.  As expected, the glitches some reviewers experienced in early releases have been addressed ... Quicken forces the software to do an upgrade to the latest generation before you can even use it.  So far it has updated itself to Ver. 8 of the 2013 app.  4. I was shocked when I saw the price of checks from Quicken.  I recall 250 checks being about $30.  Now they are about $150.  For 250 sheets of paper?!?!?!??!?  5. Since I got my first smartphone a couple of years ago I was amazed that Quicken didn't have a smartphone app.  Okay, now they finally do and it is so useless I can't believe it.  It does NOTHING.  You can't withdraw, deposit, pay, or any other of the most basic functions of banking from it.  From what I can see it tells you what your balance is (but no, it really doesn't ... my checking account has an overdraft line of credit, and Quicken includes that in calculating my cash balance).  So if I have $2000 in available funds and $4000 in overdraft protection, Quicken tells me I have $6000 liquid cash available.  There is NO way to adjust that.  6. More on the useless smartphone app ... I installed it on the first day of the month.  It told me what my income-to-date and expenditures-to-date were.  FOR THE ONE DAY!!!!  I can't set it to tell me what those values are for the past 30, 60, 90 days or year-to-date or any other useful function; only what they are for THIS month.  Useless.  7. More on the smartphone app ... oh, never mind.  It was the #1 reason I upgraded to Ver. 2013 and I will probably end up never using it.  8. I suspect some of the less-than-positive reviews were due to early release glitches in the app.  So far Quicken 2013 has ""upgraded"" itself 8 times and I find Ver 8 to be as stable as I could expect.  If I had to give up every app I own except one, the one I would keep would be Quicken.  If you have previous versions I doubt it you will find anything substantial to justify buying this newer version.  If you have never used Quicken, I think you will end up like me finding it indispensable.",69

4957.0,330,5.0,"I received Quick books Pro 2011 for review from the Amazon Vine program. Here's my take on it:  I run a jewelry design business and had been using an old version of Quicken to track inventory for tax purposes. I'd heard good things about Quick books and decided to investigate it for my home business application.  Installation was super easy. The more difficult part was learning how to make the options work for me. This is a robust program that tracks much more than inventory, also allow check writing, bookkeeping and much more. Some users take classes just to understand how to use the program effectively. I didn't avail myself of that opportunity since I was only interested in the inventory tracking portion.  The initial setup was more complicated than Quicken but allows many more options. Itemizations such as Vendor Options include Purchase Orders, the ability to receive inventory with or without invoices, enter bills against inventory and more. There's a Customer section where one can create invoices, sales receipts, refunds and credits and receive payments. Under Company one can chart accounts, items and services, and a variety of inventory related activities. Finally a Banking section lets you write checks, reconcile accounts, print checks and record deposits-in short, everything a business, large or small needs to track.  For inventory tracking, once you input a vendor and select a category (many from which to choose that include supplies, office, postage and more), it is possible to list each item bought and track stock quantities, and this was accomplished with only a quick perusal of the tutorial. I like that you can manage customer, vendor, and employee data in one place easily, with quick access to related transactions. Reports can be created instantly, but one of the items most appealing to me is that you can pick up new skills at your own pace with the built-in Learning Center. This means that starting at a basic level as I have doesn't mean that I can become more proficient as I become accustomed to the many facets of this powerful, yet easy-to-use program.  Some reviewers have complained about pop-ups that advertise extra services. A response from Intuit tells how to turn off these annoying ads.  Since I am a one-person business and don't plan to do actual banking with Quick books, the software is perfect for my needs.",923

4026.0,266,1.0,"Like you, I don't have time to write reviews -- but this product is such a disappointment I feel I must. I've used PC's for decades. Norton was once the only reliable protection -- back in the DOS days. I dropped Norton 5 years ago because it'd become a resource hog -- and went to PC-Cillin -- but it grew slower, so after 2 years I tried Norton again -- finding it still a resource hog. After 1 year, I switched to Bitdefender -- and found it much faster, but it slowed email too much --even with email scanning turned off. When the subscription ran out, I read reviews saying the ""new"" Norton was now the most efficient, with competitive protection -- and chose it for the coming year -- just 6 weeks ago. It's turned out to be unuseable -- unpredictable slow-downs (even in ""Silent Mode"") with system lock-ups (no blue screens, but same effect). I can't wait a year this time. I'll just have to write-off the expense and find another. Truth is, I've no way to vet the reviewers -- too many are ""planted"" by the manufacturers -- or seduced by their advertising money. IT MAY WORK FINE on many machines, BUT Norton 360v3 is the worst I've encountered -- so bad I can't wait until next year to find one that serves me.",24

576.0,45,1.0,"Outdated? Yup. Don't let the 2004 moniker fool you. This is just the latest rehash of a product that is completely outdated and hasn't had a real update in quite some time. They slap some new graphics on every year, but for anybody using Windows XP (or anything derived from NT or later) you're completely wasting your money and the only thing of value will be the Antivirus software. (Don't get me wrong, the Norton Antivirus software is slow and bloated, too, but at least it does the job well otherwise.) Under XP all the other utilities are either disabled, or very close to useless. The native disk check and defragmenter that come with XP work either the same or better than what comes with Norton. Please don't make the same mistake I did. Save your money; there are MUCH better utility suites out there for XP.

10003.0,630,4.0,"This is a very full featured package and a good value.  This software has an incredible number of features and options. And as there is no manual, it's a bit of ""trial and error"" to learn your way around. It's reasonably well organized and the main functions are easy enough to use.  The basic editing features are easy enough. There are a lot of add-ons included which I need more time to explore. I think you are getting a lot for your money, in that respect. Lots of templates and effects are provided which may make things easier for you.  The straight forward tasks like titles, trimming, combining and re-sequencing are easy to do. An audio editor is included which is nice.  One feature I was looking for and think will be important to many is the ability to sync video using the audio tracks. For example, I sometimes shoot video with my camera, but also record the audio separately using a better, external mikes and audio recording unit. I then need to sync the external audio with the camera video (using the audio track recorded by the camera). The idea is to merge the waveforms together to find the sync points.  This feature is included, though I have not had a chance to test it yet.  If it works well, it would be worth the price of admission (for me) alone.  I have seen separate software for this purpose which sells for as much or more than this package.  There aren't any significant limitations that I have found so far. You have plenty of tracks available and tons of options to tweak nearly everything. All the usual video enhancements, transitions and tools are there. You even get a mobile app and 10 GB of cloud storage!  I like what I've seen, so far, of the Editor capabilities. Things seem pretty quick and responsive. And, as a photographer, I think the Slideshow Creator shows promise. They look good and seem easy enough to use.  There are tutorials on their web site that look helpful, but I have not yet had time to peruse them.  I also note they have of trial versions of their software products available on their web site which may be of interest if you are considering purchasing this.  This is a very full featured and capable package for the money and a good value.  So 4 stars based on good performance speed, tons of features, and a reasonable price.",1014
430.0,24,5.0,"For the first time in many years I have been pleased with a Microsoft Windows family OS.  When Windows XP came out I obtained what I was really expecting, a very solid, stable and enhanceable system. Windows XP is based on the Windows 2000 code base with several major multimedia, administrative tools and security enhancements among other things. This is really the closest you can get to a truly standard OS for all types of users, except system administators obviously.  We are getting closer to not having different Windows flavors running around anymore. The acceptance of this OS will gradually relieve developers from having to design multi-platform applications, a major headache in the past.  As of this writing, Windows 95 has almost been phased out, and almost every piece of software is written for Windows XP (Home and Professional) I've tested this OS on my personal laptop (Thinkpad T-21) and several Pentium family desktops (P-III 750Mhz and P-IV 2.4Ghz) with many different software and hardware combinations without major issues.  Software drivers are becoming quickly available for all types of hardware.  In terms of software applications, I had to wait a bit longer for a few applications to become XP compatible. As with any OS, the compatibility issues were higher when the OS was released, but now you will not find as many, unless you still own very old pieces of hardware and software.  This is in my opinion the primary factor when deciding wether to upgrade or to stay where you are. I will not get into the features of the OS, as they are very well described by Amazon and other reviewers, what I can tell you is what I consider the major highlights of this OS: * Great multimedia features - MovieMaker, Media Player.  Windows Explorer has also been expanded with options to manage digital media such as pictures and music.  Multimedia devices are installed and configured easier than ever * CD Burning options built in - Creating a music or data CD is as easy as drag and drop.  It may not be the most efficient burning system, but its a good place to start * Administrative Tools - The Disk administrator, along with the disk defragmenter are two enhanced tools that I rely on with XP * Windows Update - Microsoft has been updating the OS frequently with many security fixes and tools updates and enhancements. You can set up XP to update your system periodically * Networking - Setting up a network is much easier now.  A firewall is also built in as part of the network security features new in XP * System Help - The help tool has been enhanced to search not only locally on the PC but through the Internet as well.  General Help Topics are very detailed and descriptive with many illustrations.  Great improvement here. * Wizards - Many more settings are performed with wizards.  Is like filling an electronic questionnaire, then XP takes over the rest of the configuration steps based on your answers. And simply the looks.  Icons are more colorful, and they take  advantage of higher end video cards with more color options.  You can select display settings to look like the old Windows or the new XP look. In terms of performance, I admit that Windows by design, does not consider low end machines and it may seem slow on low RAM machines.  I would definitely recommend having more than 256MB of RAM and a high end Pentium processor (P3 and up) for acceptable performance.  Fortunately, there are options to tweak performance settings by eliminating the sometimes unnecessary display effects. I think at this time, you may be assured that Windows XP will be the best choice for you.  Don't hesitate to buy it, taking into consideration the points I mentioned above. Recommended",378

That's due to the fact I will not pay more than $20 a year for internet security for two to three computers.  In past years, I've always gotten the Security Complete for actually less than that either here at Amazon or a last year version at eBay.  This year, the Webroot prices have not been that low at Amazon, and I fear getting older versions now due to Webroot's new policy of cutting off support to older versions. (A policy I cannot understand to save my live, regardless of how many times I read it.)  Also, this year the Antivirus was always $19.99 at Amazon for the PC download, until I needed it this week.  It actually went up to $39.99 the night I was going to buy it!  That made me think: Kaspersky here I come!  But Kaspersky went up this week, too.  (I've been checking the prices for both for weeks.)  Fortunately, I noticed the Webroot Antivirus PC disc was still $19.99; and why the disc would be cheaper than the download is beyond me.  Moreover, you don't even have to use the disc if you can't or don't want to when it arrives.  You can still download the software from the Webroot website, because all you need is the product keycode.  So, here we are . . . one difference I see between the Webroot Antivirus and the Security Complete is there is no maintenance button where you get rid of temporary internet files and such.  But I certainly don't need Webroot to do that little task.  There's also no firewall, but the Windows 10 firewall is fine with me.  (See comments below about a firewall.)  In addition, you can't put the Antivirus on cell phones or tablets, as you can with the Security Complete.  Once again, not a problem for me; I have a Microsoft phone that can't take a download of Webroot, and from what I understand about Fire tablets, no security software is needed.  Thus, one more hopefully happy year with Webroot.  I do really like Webroot.  It just stays quietly in the background and does its job, and does its job well.  Yet I'm not paying more than $20 a year for it for two or three devices, regardless of how much I like it.  P.S. Contacting Webroot tech or sale support is simple.  You just right-click the Webroot icon, choose ""help and support"", and then  you can easily contact them by clicking ""send us a message"" at the bottom of the page you are taken to.  You get an e-mail back when they have answered, giving you a link to click, which takes you to a page which not only includes your current question and the answer, but also all the other questions, with answers, you have ever asked Webroot.  My questions go back to 2012!",962
4028.0,266,3.0,"I was a Norton Utilities/Internet Security user for 5 years in the 2001-2006 period. Every September when they were updating the suite I would buy the next one. Typically for Norton, in the first months after the release, the software would suck because they were releasing it before it was ready.  Through the years, the software got worse and I started looking for alternatives and for a while I went with different packages. As of this year I heard only good thing about the Norton Suites and I decided to try Norton 360. I also use Norton Internet Security which I like better. Norton 360 is a well rounded application suite which has extra features in addition to the Internet Security programs (firewall, antivirus, identity protection, etc). The most important additions are the Backup and the PC optimization. In my case I don't use the Backup part because it does not suit my needs but I can see that some people will use it and like it. Symantec offers the options of backing up online (2GB of space is free, for more than that you have pay), to an external HDD or to an optical drive. On the other side, I find the PC Optimization application almost useless. I did not see any difference in performance and that stopped me also from buying Norton System Works for my computers without 360 (System works includes the optimization tool).  Overall since the previous versions, they improved one important aspect of all the suites: SPEED! Before, installing Norton programs on your machine was like condemning the PC to a slow death, not you can barely notice the software is there. Another complain I have is regarding the Antivirus part. At times, the antivirus is paranoid also reporting false positives. While this is not necessarily a bad thing (better safe than sorrow), it will not let you customize the action it takes. In the previous versions and on the enterprise editions (I use Symantec antivirus at work) it would allow you to change the way it behaves if it finds a threat (for ex. quarantine the file instead of deleting it). Now, the program will delete the file automatically without even asking. That is unacceptable in my book. The user should have the right to decide what to do. Norton Internet Security behaves the same way and I hate it.  Overall, it is a good suite for family PC(s). If you don't need the backup, save your money and go with the Internet Security suite instead of paying more for the 360!",419

I guess that may come in handy for some one that does not already have the clients loaded on their local systems.  I have a bunch of stuff on Microsoft OneDrive so I put this to the test and had it zip up some of my older folders.  I don't know if this was their first release that integrates with these cloud services, but I am assuming it was.  It is a slow synchronous process that blocks you from doing a second task with the tool, unless you want to open up a completely different instance.  The WinZip developers better learn how to do these jobs asynchronously and in the background so the UI can continued to be used.  Over all I found no real need to replace my current tools with it, but if you are looking for a tool, this may be the one for you.

McAfee Live Safe works with Android, IOS & Kindle Devices (and pc's macs). So you won't have to worry about your smartphone,ipod, or tablet being compatible. McAfee LiveSafe is similar to other versions of McAfee and comes with a built in Virus software to help you protect against Malware,Spyware and of course other Viruses that may infect your device. It also comes with a slimmed down version of a Firewall called ""Web Security"" which you can switch on and off at will, however in my experience it has never interfered with anything I am doing online unlike some other firewalls so i always keep it on for extra security.  What is special about McAfee Live Safe is that it is a universal licensed product. Meaning that for 1 yr you can protect as many devices as you wish with only once purchase of the code.

6064.0,406,4.0,"Update: 01 April 2012.  Writer first, page designer second, graphic artist third. Realistic human shapes and postures give me the most trouble, so when Poser 9 came down the Vine, I decided to see if it could help me set scenes for book covers and interiors. As it turns out, Poser is a powerful program with a great deal of plug-in and model support, albeit with a lot of features and nuances to learn. It also demands a current system to run smoothly.  --Enter the Program--  Installation was uneventful. Poser 9 comes in Mac and Windows flavor on a single disc, 32-bit only. Including the 3 gigabytes of model content, it clocks in over 4 gigs total on my hardrive. Smaller than many of my modern games, I can tell you.  Once it comes up, I get a touch overwhelmed by the layout. Controls are not quite as intuitive as they could be, and even with helpful dials and knobs and icons, they don't always go quite the directions I would expect. Models don't follow a standard for labeling their controls, so what makes a pair of nunchucks move one way, will make a pair of handcuffs move a different way when turning the same dial.  Camera controls are typical for a 3D editing program, which is to say that you cannot simply mouse around the models and their stage, but must use keyboard and GUI controls. The same goes for moving props around. You don't simply load things in and have it snap to your model. A lot of camera movement, dial spinning, and menu commands are required. Also, Poser 9 kicks off with minimal defaults. So if you want your models to have realistic bone constraints, instead of being tugged around like a Gumby doll, you'll have to go in and check off the option. Finally, there are a lot of meshes and magnets and constraints and scattering surfaces and other tools to master for the final look. I haven't tried the animation features yet, but the program allows you to render still images which can be exported to a variety of contone formats, including the popular PNG, TIF, BMP, and JPG. These renders look good even on the default setting; however, colors that aren't apparant in the posing window will appear in the render, so you might have to switch back and forth for adjustments.  Once you get the hang of the control nuances, things move quickly enough. The dials turn out to be a good way for posing of limbs and digits, while the mouse works the user interface and moving whole models around. The presets and bundled content are accessible enough to learn, and there is a lot of free stuff on the net to explore. Which leads me to...  --DAZed and Compatible--  One of the first things I did with Poser was to install models from Daz Studio. Victoria 4 and Michael 4 are two of the latter's most popular characters. To go with that popularity are hundreds of hair, clothing, and gadget accessories (many of them costing in excess of $29 a pop). Hair alone is a racket. So when 3D Daz had a promotional giveaway for the base package of both figures, I installed them. Additionally, I've downloaded dozens of props and stages designed for Poser, Daz, or both, from 3D Daz, Renderosity, and various other vendors. Poser 9 allows you to access the Smith Micro Store from within the program. I did not attempt to load Genesis, which are the newest figure series, and which I am told are not compatible with Poser 9 without work around.  Speaking of workarounds, Poser object installation is mostly straight forward. When you launch the executable for a given model, make sure you select it as a Daz Studio item when the dialogue box asks you to chose. Then in the next dialogue box, install it to your root Poser Content folder (installed by default in My Documents on Windows 7) instead of Daz--NOT to Poser's actual runtime directory. Finally, the very first time you install a model, you have to go into Poser itself, and tell it to recognize its own Content folder. Also, you have to restart Poser for them to be recognized. This is easier than it sounds, and instructions are also available on vendor sites.  --Poser Performance--  I tested this program on a five-year old HP media center PC, with a Core 2 Duo E6600 processor, four gigs of RAM, and a 250GB platter drive at 3 Gigabit/s transfer speed. Run on Windows 7 Home Premium.  It works in default settings, but definitely moves sluggishly. Even small props take several seconds to load, and textures may be delayed by an additional few seconds. Moving the models around can bring a touch of stutter if you have a room loaded and there are a number of lighting or particle effects in the scene. The program also crashed on me a couple times, which I suspect has more to do with system limitations than the software.  Since then, I've used the program for work on a custom Intel machine with a i5-2500, DZ68 mobo, 8 GBs of 1600 mhz RAM, and a Radeon HD6850. I boot the app off a Crucial M4 solid state drive, and store the content on a WD Caviar Black platter drive--both SATA III. Booting is initally slow, but after a few sessions the cache catches up and it loads just a little slower than my Adobe apps. Models can be moved smoothly, scenes render faster, and there is much less texture popping.  On that note, 64-bit processors have been commercially available for a few years now, and anybody who seriously uses Poser is going to have more than 4 gigs of RAM. So it would be helpful to have an x64 bit version of the software. While some Operating Systems can allocate more to their 32-bit programs, Windows usually caps them at about 3.2 - 3.4 GBs.  --Applause--  Overall, Poser 9 is more of a ""prosumer"" product than something for beginners or hobbyists. For the latter crowd I'd consider the Debut version of the program before sinking your cash into this one. Yet it's accessibility and utility is scalable, from simple still poses to animation. It can also support a great deal of Daz Studio content in addition to the library of Poser material already available on the web, some of it free and some of it spendy. The lack of 64 bit support and a GUI that could be a little more friendly for me keep it from five stars. Neither of those are reasons to pass this program up.

1602.0,116,5.0,"Works 9.0 came ""free"" on my new computer. Since I ran out of Office 2003 licenses and never liked Office 2007, I decided to use Works 9.0 for a while, knowing it was nothing like Office 2003.  For basic tasks -- appointments, word processing (as long as you're not trying to write a book), spreadsheets (as long as you don't need multiple worksheets or complicated formulas), and very simple database tasks -- it works surprisingly well, and the interface is very easy to learn.  What also surprised me was how fast and stable the program is.  I now simply leave it open all the time.  I like the project-based approach, whereby you pick a project theme that came with the software.  Of course, if you need serious office-suite features, nothing can beat the real Office, which is not that more expensive for the Home and Student edition.  [...]  But Works 9.0 comes free with most computer purchases, so if your workprocessing and spreadsheet needs are basic, it's a great value that can't be beat.",70

5014.0,335,2.0,"I have the limited edition with exclusive bonus pack which provides ""over $250 in extra value"" of a 2FB USB flash drive, KPT collection plug in, Corel Painter Essentials 4, and Corel WinZip 14.5 Pro. Mine came with a short quick start guide (which was too bare bones to be helpful) and a small page size 137 page paper guidebook. The fact that Corel issues different packs, some with a user manual and some without is something that some customers are upset about.  I own and older edition of Photoshop Elements (a less expensive pared down version of the professional Photoshop) and am used to PS Elements. I will note that PaintShop Photo Pro X3 is the same pricing as PS Elements and from what I have been able to figure out, the two programs are very similar in content as well.  Before I tell why I am dissatisfied I'll share my opinion that if you already have a photo editing program, you probably should stick with that product and buy updates as you feel are necessary. There is a large and painful learning curve when moving from one software to another. I just learned this the hard way. The terms are different, the process is different, and it's just too painful to put oneself through unnecessarily. I am asking myself why I bothered to want to try PaintShop Photo Pro X3 when I was happy with (my no longer latest version of) Photoshop Elements. I guess I was thinking maybe this was better and why not get this and stop using PSE? I'm sorry I wasted my time. Before I say why I don't like this program I'll give more info.  I am looking for very basic photo editing tools. I take photos with a DSLR but am more into the actual taking of well composed and well lit photographs than I am into spending hours of my time editing shots.  What I want photo editing for are some simple things such as: cropping photos, resizing photo files to make them smaller when necessary (i.e. submitting photos to newspapers and websites), to remove red eye, to make a soft edge on a photo and perhaps to adjust an overexposed or underexposed photo.  Regarding projects, which this software does, I'm honestly not sure how I would use this. When making a photo book I would make it right on the site that professionally prints the book. When I make a photo Christmas card I make the soft edge on the photo right on the warehouse store website.  When I make a photo calendar I used the warehouse store's website to create it from home on the internet, and they print it and I pick it up at the store.  I have a six month old computer PC: Windows 7 Premium and an i3 processor. It is not yet clogged up with too many files and had plenty of room on it for new programs. Installation was easy and took me about 90 minutes only because I would walk away and realize there were many steps and it was waiting for me to keep clicking more boxes.  I was confused though, over having to install multiple programs all from the same CDROM, and was unclear what the differences were between: Paintshop Photo Pro X3, Project Creator, Painter Essentials 4 and KPT collection (that one I did not even bother installing). I did the registration online; there were no phone numbers for me to call. Some reviewers mentioned ads on the screen, I saw no ads. I have over 30,000 photo files on my hard drive at the time this was installed. I don't understand why other reviewers are saying it took hours to load this software given the number of images on their hard drive.  The instruction manual was promising offering 4 ways for new users to learn to use the system: the Corel guide, the Learning Center palette, the help system and web-based resources. Despite this seemingly wonderful array of options when it came down to figuring out how to do something as simple such as resize a photo to scale it down to 72 dpi I could not find the answer. I still can't figure out how to see if it saved the file as jpg or if it is saving it with some other format (i.e. raw, gif). I was annoyed that searches with common keywords such as `resize' turned up no results. I could not find any of this information in the user manual either.  When working to edit a photo I was annoyed that multiple images I was not using were lined up at the bottom which it randomly pulled off my hard drive, it was distracting. I am used to working with a program where the only thing on your work surface is what you have chosen to work on right now. I found that I could adjust the viewing box to get larger that pushed those off the screen.  The absolute worst thing about this program which is why I am uninstalling it and giving up is ---- the program over-wrote my existing program to view photo files that were already on my hard drive. When I try to open a photo by clicking on the file on my hard drive, it opens in the Corel Instant Viewer which is a piece of garbage that first pauses for 2 seconds doing nothing while it loads, then it shows an image for 2 seconds in a pixelated blurry mess before sharpening up to view it. Moving to the next photo using the arrow, such as to view photos you took on a certain day, takes 4 seconds to load each photo and my eyes go crazy with the sharp to blurry to sharp to blurry images. I cannot stand this Corel Instant Viewer.  It is impossible to quickly click through the photos. My old software from the Canon camera would instantly load with no pause and it would immediately be in perfect focus. This thing that Corel has is ridiculous.  After spending 4+ hours installing and trying to edit one photograph to just crop it to zoom in, reading the user manual and the online help, just trying to get one photo to convert to 72 dpi and jpg format, and not being able to figure it out, I give up on the program and am going back to Photoshop Elements. The simplest editing task should not be that difficult to figure out.  At at the very least a photo program on a brand new, high speed computer should not take 4 seconds to load one photo image and make us look at it for 2 seconds blurry first - there is no need for such madness.",736

3436.0,220,4.0,"I had high hopes for this software, as Rosetta Stone has a very high profile and is quite expensive.  I evaluated it simply to see what the quality of the product was; I am already an intermediate level Mandarin speaker (native English speaker).  Rosetta Stone has one core thing right: the principle that you learn a foreign language best by avoiding ""translation"" in your head.  It is much better to learn Chinese by seeing a picture of an apple and saying/hearing ""pingguo"" than it is to look at it and think ""apple"" in English and trying to translate to Chinese.  In this regard, their method is effective.  Where this program is lacking, however, is in not teaching the Chinese characters.  It sounds strange to English speakers, but it really is true that learning the characters is absolutely essential to learning to speak the language well.  (I resisted this at first too, but luckily a college professor saved me from my wrong thinking).  I would love to Rosetta add an option in the software that allows you to learn the characters as an intrinsic part of learning the language.  If you're just trying to learn to be conversant, and don't want to learn the characters, and prefer not to be tied to your computer, I find the Pimsleur CDs to be a better option.  Overall- good program - but don't fall for the hype that learning Chinese is going to be easy.  It's a lot of hard work; this is a decent aide for starting that long journey.",975

9448.0,602,5.0,"Id used Dragon NaturallySpeaking previously. Actually Id used a couple of different versions over the years. All of them required extensive effort spent training the Dragon before you could actually use it. Often, it included problems with the Dragon understanding my accent. With this version, there were none of those issues. I read one short paragraph and proceeded with the rest of the set up instructions. I also did the short tutorial. Once that was done, I opened a word document and proceeded to start dictating to it. It had very little trouble understanding what I was saying. Because of that alone, this is definitely a five-star piece of software.  Now once its installed it is a wonderful piece software use, but the installation was the slowest installation of a program I have ever done. I was installing from a DVD, and it shouldve taken just a few minutes. However its been about 15 minutes with me wondering if the computer had frozen up. While my laptop is not top-of-the-line its also not bottom of the barrel and it is new. It uses Windows 8.1 operating system. Overall, I think it took 30 to 60 minutes just to install the program. I actually cooked dinner waiting for the installation to complete. Then, I had to come in and do the registration portion. At least the registration is quick and easy.  In the long run, I guess the slow installations worth the effort because the program is a very quick to learn to use. For people who never use Dragon NaturallySpeaking for used to take me weeks to train the program before it was fully usable. With this version, it took minutes. I have not learned all of the slight nuances of using Dragon yet, but it seems very user-friendly so far. Im thrilled at the ability to continue to write without causing pain in my arm. I highly recommend this program for anyone who has difficulty using their hands or arms for typing and mouse usage. It won't completely eliminate the need for keyboard or mouse use, but it makes it much easier to compose on your computer.  All software has a learning curve. This new version of Dragon speaking naturally has a very short learning curve before you're able to start using the program. Over the next few weeks, I anticipate learning a lot of the finer details of using the program. The only downside is when your spouse continues to talk to you and the mic begins to pick it up. Right now its a little bit slower than when I type myself, but with practice, I anticipate becoming quicker. Hopefully, one of the things that I will learn to do is how to edit a completed document by voice. Im thrilled with the program though.  As for what comes in the box, there is the DVD for insulation, a small booklet, and a headset. The headset has a mic of course. Its not the best headset in the world, however, it does work well with Dragon. Thats the headset that Im using right now as I compose this review with Dragon.",960
3564.0,225,4.0,"First of all, the real advantages of OSX 10.6 are not additional features (held to a minimum this time) but performance--especially speed and extra gigs of freed-up space.  Read the accompanying description and, without the references to Version 6, you might think you're reading deja vu all over again--all the same prattle you heard about OSX Version 5 --talk about Cover Flow, Expose, colorful panoramic views and three-dimensional perspectives.  And of course the striking photo of the cat with chillblains goes along with the emphasis on the scenic and the exotic, almost reminiscent of Apple's recent promotion of an iTouch as ""the funniest [?] iPod ever""--anything to get your attention and lead you to believe that their computers are all fun and games.  But anyone who's used these machines for an extended period knows that for all the conveniences there are exasperating delays and confounding snarls, frozen machines, uncooperative programs and internet sites, and hours of down time, often sufficient to make you wonder if all the consumer technology of the past twenty-five years has saved us any time whatsoever.  But sentiments like the foregoing may be sufficient to justify purchase of this latest edition, or ""upgrade.""  I couldn't care less about the colorful toys (I never use Cover Flow or mess with a widget)--but it's impossible to ignore the times that you sit for minutes watching the wheel turn without a file opening or a letter being sent.

What I've noticed about Version 6 is improved speed.  Internet sites that were formerly loggy, slow and snowbound seem to snap into place with zest and efficiency.  It feels like my iMac has been rejuvenated, been given some Geritol, maybe a testosterone implant.  Now the challenge will be not to load it up with all sorts of buggy software programs (many of which simply haven't caught up with the potentials of the hard-wired gear).

Eventually, though, I decided to suck it up and start to learn 2007 (and 2010, which seems pretty much the same, with a few differences that I will note below). My major problem with 2010 is the user interface at the top of the screen. While meant to be more intuitive for newer users (or people who lack technical skills or spend too much time on MySpace and Facebook), it hides the options that I used to know in places where I don't know to look. :( This creates a lot of frustration and wasted time for me.  Differences from 2007: 1) You can natively create PDFs. This was huge for me, because I like to make unalterable documents for sending to people. Native support for this is nice, even if it should just be something that you expect.  2) Cloud support. You can save items directly to your SkyDrive. Nice.  3) You can show powerpoint presentations over the internet, and your viewers only need a browser (whether this needs to be InternetExplorer, I don't know yet.)  So, if those things, along with a bevy of other features that I don't personally use, but are apparently available (Embedding web videos into presentations, Macros for Outlook, an altered Print functionality (which I actually hate), video editing tools in Power Point, built in screen capture tools, the ability to make a video of your power point slides, and some garbage about making Outlook interact with your social networking sites) make this sound worthwhile, then by all means, pick it up.  I expect that they have also removed a large number of security problems (and made a series of new ones while they were at it) as well.  So, for all intents and purposes, it is Microsoft Office. You already know if you hate it. But you have to live with it, and I think that this one is better than 2007, if not as good as 2003.  Harkius",1144

6602.0,437,3.0,"Windows 8 (W8 hereafter) is one of those ""attaboy"" or E for Effort type of deals - it looks good on the surface but after using it a while it becomes obvious something is missing or not working properly.  As something of a background I've been using Windows since the 80s DOS days.  I'm not a newbie and have owned or worked on computers running DOS, 3.x, Me, 2000, NT, XP, Vista, 7 and now 8 from the MS family.  First, let's get down to the nitty-gritty.  W8 is not a new operating system.  It's a melding (or welding) or the Windows Metro user interface (UI) from their smartphones and Windows 7.  When you boot you'll see the Metro UI first but 7 is lurking in the background.  For those unfamiliar with the Metro UI, it's a series of tiles (square or rectangular) that represent apps.  Touching or clicking these tiles opens the corresponding app.  Great for tablets or touch screens, somewhat questionable for computers.  Second, priorities and functions are clearly set.  Metro handles apps while 7 handles programs and the two don't cross in that respect.  Although MS is coming out with an Office suite that works in Metro like an app, anybody with earlier versions of that software package will notice it doesn't work in the Metro app area but does quite nicely in the Windows 7 area.  If you have no experience with apps, the best explanation I can give is that they are program wannabes - sort of like putting racing tires on a Prius.  It may look sporty but you're still not topping 80 anytime soon so don't plan on racing a real sportscar like a Porsche.  But this is where it gets confusing.  Although Metro handles apps it also creates tiles for the programs (mostly) found or installed under the 7 area.  Clicking on these tiles doesn't open the program in Metro but instead causes a flip in which 7 opens and then so does the program.  For example, installing the LibreOffice suite for Windows will create tiles in the Metro apps (one for each segment of the suite) but clicking on them means your computer must switch from the Metro interface over to 7.  Fortunately, it's relatively seamless and many won't notice it right away and it became so fast over time it's hardly apparent anymore.  Without getting into overly elaborate detail I'm going to list the pros, cons and neutrals I've found in testing W8.  Pros  * Quick boots.  I average about 25 seconds to the Metro UI but read my note in cons below about the 7 boots.  * Actually kept most of my programs intact and those that wouldn't work anymore were probably not anything I really cared about to begin with (old XP relics, mainly).  * It's cheap at the moment.  Those in possession of a recently purchased computer can get Pro for $14.99 and those using 7 on an older purchase can buy it for $40 via MS ($70 through some of the online outlets but many are offering $30 rebates via gift cards).  I believe those prices are good through January.  Cons  * While the Metro UI boots in 30 seconds or less, 7 is still grinding away in the background.  In fact, if you click on the desktop icon in Metro and flip over to 7 right after booting you'll get the usual swirling circle indicating it has another minute or so to completion.  * Horribly installation times.  Upgrades are a rather torturous 2 hours and there were times I wondered if the process had failed.  Full installations fared better at roughly 45 minutes.  * Using a laptop on battery?  The Windows 7 interface has a battery icon but Metro doesn't.  The only way to tell battery level I could see was the force my mouse to the right side and then go to Settings at which time an icon pops up; however, it disappears when your mouse moves.  * It says it will save files, docs and assorted personal items during installation but I found that to be hit or miss.  Some were easy enough to locate but others just flat disappeared.  Never did find some of my music files.  * Apps are slow to open and I do mean slow, plus many of them won't work without an active internet connection.  In some cases it takes longer for apps to open than for W8 to boot into Metro.  Go figure.  * Metro uses a horizontal scrolling (left to right instead of up and down) and if your mouse doesn't handle that you'll better get used to grabbing the scroll bar at the bottom and dragging.  * Metro didn't create tiles for roughly half of my programs even though they were still there. That's why I ended up installing the Classic Shell program (read below under Neutrals about that).  * The new Internet Explorer is a disaster.  It's slow to open and failed twice to even open it's own MS website.  That doesn't bode well.  Neutrals  * Apps are limited at this point to a few hundred and some, like Angry Birds Space, are rather pricey at $5.  Google Play this ain't although I'm sure the choices will improve over time.  * Yet other apps sort of lie.  Free to me means no charge but some are just free ""front"" apps and you have to pay to actually use them to any great degree (such as Hulu Plus which gives you a free app but wants a monthly fee to view programs).  * The Metro interface is ugly and has limited themes.  Again, I'm sure that'll change over time.  * No Start button; however, I added a freeware program called Classic Shell and it restored the Start button.  * Like those desktop gadgets for time, weather, etc?  They are no more nor can you add them. MS dropped support and instead replaced them with tiles in the Metro area.  Fat lot of good that does you when working in 7.  * Many computers users I deal with don't like having a sign-on password but W8 requires one and I haven't heard of a successful way of getting out of it right now (some online hints I've seen are somewhat suspect).  Overall I gave W8 a three star rating (because I couldn't give 2.5 stars).  If you have 7 and are satisfied, keep it.  If you can get it for the discounted $14.99 it might be a decent investment but there is a learning curve so be prepared.  Update:  A neighbor found a snafu with W8 on laptops.  When shutting down the screen will go black but DO NOT assume the computer is off.  It actually has another 15 to 20 seconds before it fully shuts off.  As my friend discovered, shutting the cover before the power and/or hard drive activity lights go out means you might be sending it to hibernation or suspend mode.  As a result, the battery is still draining since the computer didn't shut down all the way!",546

I wasn't expecting much.  I was blown away. On the same computer with the same sound card and other equipment, I went from about 60% accuracy to at least 90% accuracy out of the box. Far fewer glitches with this version, too... my old version began inserting random periods and refusing to capitalize the beginnings of sentences. This software makes my job tons easier and doesn't frustrate me at all. If you're hesitating because you haven't liked old versions, I suggest giving it a second shot. I'm very glad I did.  The headset-- it worked just fine, but it wasn't comfortable on my head. I've used two others since then (not expensive ones), all with good results.  Four stars because their tech support is a joke.

To solve my problem, I paid extra for their accounting service (which I believe is included in this year's special) and it was excellent. They suggested that I just modify information in my 2013 TT file after submission, and use that to more accurately get an idea of the estimate for the following year, given there will be changes in the tax codes. Otherwise, while the software was somewhat confusing, especially if you have to continue on another day, it did work for me in 2013 and in prior years. Also, in contrast to prior years, in 2013 it took forever to be connected to a person for free assistance. The community help feature was worthless.

5271.0,355,4.0,"I was given the opportunity to review Office Professional 2010.  I am a fairly competent user of Microsoft Office products, having used previous versions including 2007, 2003 and 2000. I will review this in terms of changes that I have become aware of, and the overall quality of the product. Word 2010 1. Ease of Setup:  Unlike the bad old days of putting programs on the hard drive, this program came on a single DVD disk.  As I had a previous version of Word, I was asked if I wanted to upgrade the program - which I did.  It took about 10 minutes for the process to be completed. Overall this was very fast. 2. Program:  if you are used to Word 2003 or earlier, the user interface is quite different.  More choices appear as tabs, rather than the older style.  This certainly takes some getting used to as you will have to locate where a certain tool might be located. 3. Visual: I believe that the aesthetic is quite nice.  The look overall of the program, once you become more familiar with the layout, is actually more simple and elegant.  It does take some adjustment from previous versions like Word 2003, but I now find this version much easier to use.  I also believe it is more intuitive for the user. Other programs: The Office Professional Suite adds Excel, Outlook, Publisher, Access and Power Point in addition to Word. From the visual standpoint, the same tab system that is used in Word is applied here to the other programs. Power Point Power Point is a powerful program that allows the user to put together nice slide show presentations.  Here, PowerPoint 2010 adds the tabs across the screen.  This is a huge improvement over the 2007 version as it seems that the many features of PowerPoint are more easily located.  I very much appreciate that it is far easier to set up new slides in the presentation and locate all the different features that were previously more difficult to locate.  This program is a huge improvement over previous versions and I think most users will be very happy with the new more intuitive approach. Excel Again, this version is a significant improvement over previous versions of Excel, including the 2007 version.  Instead of previous versions which made the user locate the pull down window which may have held the required options, Excel 2010 has tabs that only require the user to go to the logical place where the desired option would be located and do the required task. I believe that this version of Excel is probably the easiest and most intuitive version I have ever used of this powerful program. Outlook As above, I believe that this version of Outlook is far better and easier to deal with than previous versions I have used.  Set-up is much easier with a far more guided experience than previous versions that seemed to depend on the user know certain bits of information.  Here, the set-up program just asks for the desired e-mail address and password, and it seeks to set up the information itself.  This is a little but appreciated update, because on my previous 2003 version, set-up was so frustrating that I had to try over multiple sessions. Overall, I believe that this is a superior version of Outlook and I look forward to giving more updates as I go through more of this program.  Conclusions: I believe that Office 2010 is a tremendous improvement over previous versions.  If you are using Office 2003 or earlier, than I think this is a major improvement and a necessary purchase.  If you have Office 2007, then I believe that this is not such a vast improvement that you must upgrade this version.  Overall, I was not initially impressed with the vast suite of programs.  Yet, on more continuous use, I believe that Microsoft has vastly improved the Office canon.  Believe me, at first you will curse and scream in agony over the choices that have been made.  Where is my favorite tool or feature that was supposedly upgraded you will as over and over.  You will certainly consider yourself to be stupid for making the purchase.  But, if you stick with these programs, you will eventually use it and believe it makes a great deal of sense and begin to become proficient with the programs.  In other words, there is a significant learning curve with these programs.  If you understand this and give it time, I believe that you will, like me, learn to appreciate what has been put into the Office suite.",1352

The reason I've given it 4 stars instead of 5 (the first time I've done that with this series) is because there are several places where what you have to do to move on is illogical, and for these same areas, there isn't any hints to let you know what to do.  As a result, I wound up having to consult ""UHS Hints"" (a really good website where you can find hints to all the Nancy Drew games) a lot more than I would have liked...  ""Shadow Ranch"" is situated in the Arizona Desert - and the graphics of this area are great!  The mystery surrounds strange happenings that are occuring on the ranch - such as a phantom horse riding through at night, always accompanied by a major mishap at the ranch (a snake bite, power lines become downed, pump house floods).  Nancy finds out early in the game that there are rumors about an old bank robber who had hidden a treasure for his sweetheart - who used to live at the ranch.  So your job, as Nancy Drew, teen detective, is to 1. find out who or what is behind all of the strange mishaps - are they linked to the phantom horse, or does it just appear that way?  And 2. find the treasure - if there is one...  In order to get around the desert, you get to ride a horse - be sure to look around at everything you can find about riding horses before you begin, or you just might find yourself falling off a lot!!!  Overall, I found this game to be fun to play, although it did become quite frustrating at times...  If you find yourself having difficulty as I did, I'd recommend going to the ""UHS hints"" website - they allow you to choose how many hints to take, and you can always get a few before you're given the full answer - this way, if you just need a push in the right direction, you don't have to see the full answer and ruin the fun of figuring out for yourself.",140

12375.0,221,4.0,"I tried this software out in several languages, and found the learning process to be very easy and intuitive.  I'd recommend it for learning a language, although it will never compare to living in a foreign country and speaking only that language.  Pros: Rosetta stone's process is a lot better than traditional ""current language word = foreign language word"" learning processes, which rely on memorization and lead to internal translation from the foreign language to one's native language while speaking.  Rosetta stone converts foreign words straight to pictures and ideas, eliminating internal translation to one's native language.  There is plenty of repetition of previous words, but at no point does the process seem like rote recitation.  The software is divided into ""lessons"" which introduce new words, and have several exercises including matching, pronouncing each part of the word, verbally filling in blanks with your new words, etc.  There is plenty to keep you interested and ensure that you learn new words and phrases.  The voice recognition was decent, a simple training has the program hearing you correctly ~90% of the time, and an adjustable slider can reduce the pickiness the software has if you're having issues, although that also controls how strictly you want to be held to pronunciation.

In other words, it's more advanced than most amateur programs, without quite the same editing capabilities as PhotoShop-- but PhotoShop is much harder to learn.  -It does a good job with basic editing-- simple to crop, adjust brightness, fix blemishes, etc.  -Some great photo effects-- I'm really enjoying playing around with ""film and filters,"" Time Machine, and selective focus, but there are lots more to play with.  -If you don't own any good photo editing programs, you might as well start with X5.  -Great price for such a powerful piece of software.  CONS  -No printed manual  -Red eye removal, while still better than most programs of this type, still needs improvement-- you can generally tell that something's been ""red-eye-removed."" It's no better in version 5 than in version 4.  -Same with the ""One-Step Photo Fix"" command, which is useless. Everything comes out almost very high contrast with too-bright colors. Same as version 4.  -Glitchy. This is where it went from 4 stars to 3... When I open a new photo, it automatically brings it into ""edit"" mode. If I then try to go to ""adjust"" mode, my photo vanishes, never to be seen again. I swear. Even if I go back to ""edit"" mode, my photo is gone. I haven't figured out a fix for this yet. I'm using Windows 8 on a great new machine and will ask customer service what's up.  -When you use the FB ""share"" button, it automatically uploads it as public. If you want your photos to be private, you then have to go to Facebook and change their privacy settings. At that point, you might as well just upload directly from FB rather than from PaintShop.  --- Average users may never max out the capabilities of this program, but it's nice to know that there are so many features to play with if you want to.",565
7543.0,499,1.0,"As of early November 2013, this is not ready for prime time. With a library of around 10,000 songs, it is a very frustrating experience. The app is very slow to respond. Spends too much time obsessing with thumbnails and syncing and refreshing and other things in the background and does not prioritize music playback and user input. Especially when you are in the ""Computer"" tab. If I want to play music that lives on my actual computer, it should be click and play immediately. Not wait for syncing and whatever else the app is doing before it lets you play music.  Part of the problem is that it only has two library viewing options, and they are both graphics heavy. It should have an additional option that is a plain list of albums and songs. You pick an album and play it. You know, a music player! Not a gallery of pretty pictures. The left pane keeps refreshing or doing whatever it is doing, adding to the frustration and unpredictability of the program.  I thought iTunes was slow and bloated, but after using this, *shock*, it gave me a new appreciation of iTunes. It's that bad.  To add insult to injury, the ""download"" option of the web browser version of the Cloud Player now sends you to this desktop app. The desktop app makes the browser version of the Cloud Player look like a work of art.

Course, I should have kept all of the receipts in order all along but that would be efficient! Downside of the program is when you use the item deduction portion. I was not happy.  This is the reason for 4 stars.  I found it to be inadequate and lacking in many of the items people would normally donate to a charity.  Disappointing. Regardless, I will use TurboTax as it fits my needs and I am very careful to check what's included and what's been changed.  It was hard to find out about some of the forms, but consultation on Amazon through reviews was very helpful.

It's optimized for netbooks: you can install off a thumb drive (though it's a very tiny amount of space, so don't expect to be able to use the drive for much beyond installation), the stripped down features mean performance is relatively good, and it also doesn't take up a lot of space on your netbook's usually very small hard drive.

4502.0,296,2.0,"I have used several versions of streets and trips in the past and have always felt it was a decent product and worked well enough, but had room for lots of improvements.  This was back in the day when only a select few had internet on their phones and Google didn't even have maps (mainstream at least, definitely not satellite views).  I had high hopes for Mappoint where it is supposed to be for ""business"" and I suppose it does have some nice features like being able to create sales territories or zones and such, but aside from that and a few other features, it is almost identical to streets and trips.  Granted, I have not used most of the ""collaborative"" or ""analysis"" functions, but I still can not see justifying the cost.  I'm not going to go into detail here (because several other reviewers already illustrated my same thoughts) but my main complaints are still the following:  - Poor search bar integration and results (i get much better results using google maps and typing in the search term while viewing the area I want to search, in MP and S&T I get results all over the US and Canada).  There were some instances where it simply could not find addresses. - Poor quality maps (google and bing offers better rendered maps and SATELLITE (they could at least offer that option to view when you have an internet connection, but instead, they have a toolbar button that links to Bing) - Inability to create list in MP and export out - Could not figure out how to multi level sort and filter imported database  While I'm sure MP has its uses, I do not see it being that useful a tool in my business (I am not in Sales and Marketing).  So like another reviewer said, download the trial first to see if it does what you want before you commit yourself to the $250+ to own it.  My last thought is that if S&T is similar (which I can' t see why it wouldn't be), even at it's lower price, I think it needs serious updates especially in this age where wireless modems, tethered phones, and standalone GPS devices are getting cheaper and more capable.",78

Money has evolved over the years into an enormous resource for helping users get their financial investments together. The application is becoming more and more integrated allowing users to take care of such task as paying bills online, buying a car, house or any other type of household activity concerning how you spend money. It organises the users investments. It's also a wonderful budgetting tool, comparing itself to Quicken. But the thing about Money 2003, is the interface, it's more pleasing to look at and based on my observation more easier to use based on it's intuitive wizards. I really recommend you purchase money if you don't have it. I implore users. If you are a Quicken user, stick with it, I think Quicken is more powerful than Money regardless of the many bells and whistles it has. If you are new to the budgetting software I try Money because of the ease of use, but for long time Quicken users stick with what you use to. Should you upgrade? If you recently spent money buying Money 2002, don't worry to upgrade to it yet, wait six month's to a year, their is really no reason to rush but if you are still using a previous version of Money prior to version 2002 it's a worthy upgrade. For version 2002 users the reason why I don't recommend you upgrade is because of Microsoft's unpredictable upgrade cycle just as you might purchase this new version of Money, news about Money 2004 start's circulating, I don't want you to make any mistakes wasting your money, here.",368
9533.0,608,1.0,"i'm updating a prior review.  Since I bought this product Intuit has discontinued development of Quicken. They are supposed to sell it to some other vendor. I've never seen a software sale of this magnitude work. For that reason alone this would be a two star rather than three star purchase.  What takes it down to 1 star is that today I'm getting Quicken emails about spending patterns. I did not (knowingly) enable online access to my accounts.  Don't use this product.  -------- The market for personal finance software is not what it was 15 years ago. It is now a niche market. (The reason why that happened is beyond the scope of an Amazon review.)  I am sure nobody would develop Quicken for Windows (the gold standard) today. It's development was funded in a different era, including the painful process of establishing connections to banks. So we can't compare a new product (Quicken for Mac 2015) to that product. If you want all those features you need to run windows in a Mac VM or do dual boot.  So we compare this product to using a spreadsheet (ugh) or iBank 5. Unfortunately that's a very hard comparison to make. I mentioned this was a niche market -- I've not seen any serious head-to-head comparisons from a trusted source.  I opted for this product assuming it leveraged the bank connectivity network funded by Quicken for Windows. It does indeed do that.  It is not a stellar product. It desperately, desperately, needs a manual -- but the finance market is now so small that even niche ePublishers won't write a guide for it. Installation and configuration was quirky. Manual setup of 529 and other non-integrated investment tools is weird. I ran into several UI bugs and usability issues.  There's no Help file.  On the other hand, after initial setup it's bringing data in from a variety of investment sources and multiple US bank accounts. That's something.  I think it's worth the money. A manual might even make it four stars.",552

I can fly with 10.6 and sometimes these upgrades seem gratuitous, especially with all the problems this one reportedly caused.  But it was worse than that because Apple wouldn't let me go up one step.  The word I am thinking of starts with a B, has 8 letters, and rhymes with astards.  I had to go up to 10.8.

You can then purchase the software you like elsewhere at a lower cost compared to the manufacturer and type in the security key.  I am giving stars based on how well it protects and what are the odds of the product working well.  On the plus side Norton is bullet proof, and I can attest to that since we use it at work (it also has advantages in a network environment).  Five star protection.  On the down side, I do not like Norton since while not bad anymore, it is not fast and efficient.  But my biggest problem is that I think it is locked down so tight that it too easily causes side affects.  I tried it at home and I could not get it to work at all, which is OK since like I said, no security software works perfectly on all computers.  However I could not remove it.  I tried standard uninstall, a utility program on the Norton site, and standard windows methods including registry deletions.  I finally booted up in command mode and deleted the program that way.  However I then lost network connections and tried for three hours before I gave up and did a total new install of Windows.  It must have thought I was a virus.  We have problems at work which we solve with new installs also.  Based on my expereince and all that I hear, I feel odds are good it will not work for you hence two stars.

BitDefender was outstanding on my kids virus/malware magnet, but somehow either it or I turned off protection on my computer (granted it warned me with two big red X's and I was too dense to look that up).  The 2007 version of Trend Micro does not work on my kid's computer.  I hated the McAfee 2007 interface so I never tried the 2008 version.  Bottom line - TrendMicro, BitDefender, Norton, Panda, and others offer great protection.  Pick one and see if it works great.

It forces you to uninstall Spybot Search & Destroy which, despite thousands of people refuting Trend Micro via empirical testing and observation, Trend Micro insists will not run properly with both installed.  Spybot is an EXTREMELY PASSIVE program, not like a firewall or full-time virus blocker which tries to control your whole system.  There is no logical reason to expect it to interfere with anything, and there is universal agreement by Spybot users that it works fine.  The interface doesn't make sense.  Logically, there are options to be notified about all threats found, only some threats as the program deems necessary, or none at all.  Not logically, the option to get warnings for all threats is not on the same screen as the others.

In the past, I've used vector-based programs like Illustrator, but if you are a traditional freehand artist who just wants the flexibility of paper tools without compromises like the frustrating pen tool, this is the ticket.  The first thing I noticed when I fired up this app was the weird UI.  It consisted of the traditional menu bar and a weird looking semi-circle type menu in the bottom left of screen.  I later discovered the semi-circle is known as the Lagoon.  After a bit of playing around with the Lagoon, I instantly fell in love with it. You can call up any palette from the Lagoon, adjust colors, pens, sizes, undo errors, and pretty much perform anything available in the program from the Lagoon.  It can also be customized any way you wish.  There are a wide array of brushes and tools available for use.  You can even customize existing brushes, import brushes, or create a whole new brush. Within an hour and without any tutorials or difficulty, I was drawing and exporting cartoons into Photoshop where I balanced and evened everything out for that polished look.  I then exported to base photos to use with Comic Life.  I love the flexibility the tablet gives me.  I also love the fact that this program exports to Photoshop, so you can clean any rough edges and jazz it up even more.  I place cartoon characters against real life backgrounds and add layers of my kids to give the effect that they're in that Roger Rabbit type world.  They love it.

9952.0,625,3.0,"By now you've likely seen a ton of negative reviews and/or comments noting that the makers of TurboTax have apparently gotten a little, well, greedy.  Features that used to exist in the Deluxe level now require upgrading to the Premiere level.  Depending on how much you complain you can probably find an inexpensive upgrade to get back the features you need, but in reality it seems that plenty of people got upset at having to pay more for what they used to get or having to complain to get those features back no matter what had to be done to do so.  I'm trying to be fair here in noting that for an average user, the features that were taken away from the Deluxe version of this software probably aren't needed, but average is a highly unpredictable thing and many people might find that they actually do need those missing features and now they are expected to pay more to get it or switch to a competing product.  Realistically both products won't see serious use from me for a few more weeks.  Once employers make the earnings statements available I'll get to spend serious time working on returns and determining the good or bad news about the tax situation for my family.  While I hope for good news in that area, I'm also hopeful that Intuit will yet again learn the lessons of not upsetting their customer base.  We'll see about that in future years though, assuming I continue to willing to give them a chance.  I would note that at least one competing product (the HR Block application, for example) seems to be making a serious push to take advantage of the possible mis-steps here by Intuit.  I can't say that I blame them as it surely seems to be a golden opportunity (some people might remember how ""New Coke"" helped Pepsi make inroads against their competition) handed to them.  I suppose I could have come here and chewed Intuit a new one like others have, plopping a one-star review here and just moving on but I'd prefer to be honest in my review and note the issues that I have with the product rather than just dog-piling on here.  I've been a user of TurboTax for many years now.  Long enough to remember more than just this current year's issues with the application and stupid things that Intuit has done.  (I remember a big fuss over the equivalent of a root-kit that was installed compliments of one year's version of the product.  Apparently current management doesn't remember that mistake as they make a similarly upsetting move with this year's product differences compared to last years :-/ )  Given this year's mis-steps, and some problems I had with last year's product, I'm not sure I would remain a TurboTax user.  I seriously had intended to switch to a competing product this year (that earlier mentioned HR Block software, already purchased as part of an Amazon Gold Box deal not so long ago).  I felt forced into using that product last year (and I did buy it last year) as I had issues with a never fixed 'bug' in last year's TurboTax software.  While last year's taxes were a little more complex for my family than a typical year, they shouldn't have been that confusing and yet last year TurboTax caused me a lot of grief with my state tax filings and in the end caused a serious delay in getting the refund I was due.  I hope this year's version is better in that area but won't know for sure until a few weeks from now when I have all of the required paperwork in hand.  Given that I have both the HR Block product for this year and the copy of this year's TurboTax product to double check things with, I am pretty sure I'll be able to e-file this season without issue as one product or another will work for me I'm sure.  I have installed both products and have a couple of thoughts about both that I'll put here.  Both products irritated me a bit as they both wanted my personal information for product registration and/or activation (HR Block wants an activation code to be entered).  Neither product was smart enough to actually look for last year's tax return files to grab my personal information from to pre-fill that information out.  Given that a few steps later in the process the applications both read last year's returns and import personal information from same it seems both could make a little more effort to save customers time in that area.  I can note that the Block product didn't ask the questions about what product I used last year and/or where I purchased my products from.  It really doesn't take long to complete the information but it bugs me that I have to sit and type in information that is there for the taking if the apps used a smarter process for starting up.",1007

Still, if you use dialup, you might just want to order the software.  Overall, I was happy with the download  PRODUCT: If you're a quicken user, this is just quicken.  They did a facelift to it so that it looks somewhat like Office 2007, bigger buttons at the top.  I'll tell you what I liked right off the bat: a) I was using Quicken 2005 and integration with my Bank was very very seamless with Quicken 2010 b) Since I lost my data from the lighting strike, I wasn't able to test recovery or upgrading files (I'm sure that's standard) c) I liked that the default is a transaction is in one line (in 2005 transactions by default took too lines)  Overall, it's Quicken - it keeps track of my books and integrates nicely with my bank.  I like it.  I can't say I love it because I don't love balancing my checkbook and no matter what software was out there, it would still be a chore to do this job that needs to get done.  I have to say, Quicken makes it about as easy as you possibly can.  Get it, use it, it runs on Vista and Windows 7.  It's stable and reliable.  Don't get hit by lighting like my pc or all bets are off.",1104

This is a big plus in the programming and it's only benefit.  But I always wind up doing it by hand anyway.

Unfortunately, this is no longer the case.  You have to go online to get the final versions.  What if you do not have online access?  Well then you have you have to call them and are not guaranteed to get any help that way.  The headache is not worth it..  Since the IRS puts all of its final laws into place in June, can't turbo tax and other software put out there final versions by December 1?

4363.0,286,4.0,"I've had Bitdefender Total Security 2010 on a couple of my machines (a home machine and a work machine) for several months now, and we haven't had any issues.  Bitdefender appears to run smoothly and stays in the background for the most part (though there is the occasional yes / no pop-up to respond to), and it very rarely becomes a system drag during normal operation.  The file-by-file virus scan does drag the system down, but no worse than any other virus protection product that I've used. In fact, it's better than most - at least in my experience. I just wish there was a bit more flexibility available in how frequently the scan automatically runs.  Most importantly, we've not had any virus-related issues while this software has been deployed. I suppose that's the most critical topic, and Bitdefender has passed that test.  The application also includes some nice tune-up tools - a registry cleaner, a PC cleaner, a disk defragmenter, etc. We've used them without problem...they seem to do what they say they do.",1147

1389.0,93,5.0,"Do NOT believe all the knee-jerk garbage you're hearing about Vista, as 90% of it is being pulled out of thin air by people who obviously never even tried it.  Linux and Apple trolls scour the internet for chances to add negative reviews to an operating system they'v never even tried.  Then there are the XP hypocrites who have been using XP for so long that they fear anything new.  Hypocrytes you say?  Yup.  This same negative ""new Windows sucks"" propaganda wave happened when Windows 2000 was released in 1999 (nobody wanted ""NT"") and again when XP was released in 2002 (incompatibility problems, verybody absolutely HATED that ""Made by PlaySkool"" interface). Everybody hated each of them until the next version of Windows came along. Then, suddenly, they LOVED the older version and tried to cling to it. Not only pathetic, but now very predictable.  Vista is just the latest victim.  I have absolutely no love affair with Microsoft, trust me.  But it's time for an actual professional with a masters in programming and operating systems to set a few things straight.  Fact: Windows Vista was in development a whole year before Windows XP was even released. Microsoft had been working feverishly on this OS for 6 years at the time of its release. Little id you know that nearly EVERY Microsoft product that comes out is extensively tested by a public usability testing program that is totally seperate from their beta testing program. Microsoft doesn't let anything out the door until all the usability testers (the general public that come to visit the Microsoft facility in Redmond, Wa) say they like it. Vista was OK'd by both internal and external beta testers in addition to the usability test program, or it never would have been released. I have personally done usability testing at Microsoft 17 times now (I like to get my 2 cents in), and I know how this process works. Microsoft releases software BY CONSENSUS, and Vista is what the people themselves ASKED FOR.  Fact: For its entire life, the virus magnet that is known as Windows XP has been solely responsible for the onslaught of spyware, malware and waves of viruses. Not Mac. Not Linux. Not DOS. Not Unix. It was Windows XP. Prior to XP, Windows would see a problem virus come down the pike once in a while.  Then XP came along, and we've been swimming in viruses and Malware ever since.  Even loaded with antispy and antivirus software, WinXP STILL gets infested and slows to a blue-screening crawl. As you read this on your XP box, I guarentee that you have spyware on your system. Run a scan and see for yourself.  If you're just running Windows Defender, I guarentee you're LOADED with it and don't even know it - get better software immediately.  Fact: Though complaints about Vista's UAC are many, the Internet is not filled with Vista users begging to be saved from viruses and spyware they can't recover from. Those poor souls are pretty much all XP users.  The Vista users complaing of any viruses and spyware are the ones who turned UAC off or clicked right past the UAC warning prompts without evn reading them.  Fact: OF COURSE Vista is going to be slightly slower than XP on the same machine - just like Windows XP was slower than Windows 2000, which was much slower than Windows NT4, etc. etc. This is the natural way things are SUPPOSED TO BE AS HARDWARE GETS FASTER AND FASTER. C'mon, what do you honestly expect? New operating systems are about new features, not ""running faster"" on the same hardware (anybody that knows anything about operating systems knows that new versions are NEVER faster than the previous version, no matter what operating system it is - just take a look at any Linux distro or new version of any Mac OS). It's up to HARDWARE to make things run faster, not the OS. Your system is not fast enough to run Vista? THEN GET FASTER HARDWARE LIKE YOU HAD TO DO FOR XP. Has everyone forgotten that today's hardware is anywhere from 4-10 times faster than than the hardware that was available when XP was first released? And that XP absolutely crawled on our systems when it first came out and that we all complained about it?  And that Vista runs at virtually the same speed as XP once booted up - only with tons of new features? And that soon you will need a new OS to even be able to operate the dual quads already on the market and the dual octo-core systems right arounnd the corner? C'mon, people, get a grip and get kick that common sense glad into gear.  Fact: Since SP1 came out, Vista runs GREAT. I can run any Win32 program I want in Vista that I install, and as of SP1.  I might even be able to run old 16 bit apps now, haven't tried that yet.  Thanks to the freeware release of VDMSound, I am running old DOS games under Vista with full sound.  I repeat - DOS games.  Some of the few remaining software products currently being described as ""Non-Vista compatible"" can be made to work under Vista if you do a little reading and tweaking.  Fact:  Before SP1 came out for XP, XP ran like crap and had tons of compatibility problems.  Everybody hated it, even the way it looks.  Bet you forgot that.  Fact: Turn UAC (User Access Control) off if you want Vista to behave like XP and not prompt you for confirmations. It's as easy as un-checking a checkbox in Control Panel (User Accounts). Note: This will drop Vista security down to the same ""virus magnet/pants down"" level as Windows XP, however, so you decide.  The nice part is that you CAN decide.  Fact: Are you a gamer? Then you already know that Direct3D (DirectX) 10 is Vista-only. All you XP gamers can sit in your own DX9 drool if you want to. Meanwhile, we Vista users are walking around in DX10 games that look like movies. You oughtta see Crysis with dual nVidias running SLI.  Fact: Think you don't like Vista? Waiting for Windows 7 to come out in Q1 of 2010 (at the earliest without any of Microsoft's now legendary and predictable postponements)? You might be interested in knowing that Windows 7 is merely a re-packaging of Windows Vista - just like Windows XP was a re-packaging of Windows 2000 because 2000 didn't sell well (see for yourself at the command prompt - type ""ver"" and take note that Windows 2000 is Windows version 5.0 and Windows XP is version 5.1). Windows Vista is version 6.0. Dig up all the screen shots of Windows 7 you can find on the internet - take note that the title is ""Windows 7"" but the version number is 6.1.  In other words, STILL VISTA. So get used to Vista. Better yet, GET Vista, or you'll eventually be two Windows versions behind when 7 comes out - which won't be until 2010 (at the earliest), and then that version of Vista will be around for 5 years until the next version.  Vista's here to stay, folks. You have a choice of slipping into even more obsolescence with XP (which is just Windows 2000 with lipstick, a 9 year old product) or you can move forward with Vista and Win7.  For me personally, Vista has been spoiling me rotten since SP1 came out. Every time I get up from my Vista machines and sit down on my XP machines, it feels like I'm sitting down on a machine in ""Safe Mode"". Vista makes XP feel old, limited, cumbersome and inadequate. The search functions of Vista alone remove all need for clicking through layers of start menus, even often allowing me to not have to touch the mouse - this alone makes XP feel like an antique. I won't even get into how cool Desktop Search is, SuperFetch, ReadyBoost, or the other many new features that make Vista MUCH faster than XP in many respects.  Read that last sentence again, and then look those things up.  You may commence drolling on your poor ol' outdated XP box's keyboard.  BTW: No, I do not work for Microsoft, and I have been a huge Linux fan since 1997 (SUSE Linux, to be exact, version 11 is fantastic).  I ignore the fact that Linux always takes much longer for apps to load up (and runs clunkier in general) and that both KDE and Gnome always seems to look/work a lot like the latest version of Windows.",578

3111.0,179,1.0,"This is my revised review of Norton 360 version 2.0.  I previously had given a positive review and my review was rated as ""The most helpful favorable review"".  However, after extended use of the product I have to remove my first review and mark this product as DEFECTIVE.  I believe that if the professional review sites that have given this product positive reviews were to run extended trials and followed a policy of revising their initial ratings that they also would drop their ratings after they find that the product starts failing after extended use.  I installed the Norton 360 version 2.0 trial edition downloaded from Norton's website and ran it for 13 days on my Windows Vista SP1 PC before activating it. During that time my system did not have any noticeable computer slowdowns and it ran in the background without any need for intervention.  It also ran just fine for another 7 days after purchasing a license and activating it.  Sounds great, right?  Well, in my second week of owning it, Norton 360 v2 suddenly started having ""Service Framework"" failures and told me I should reboot my PC to ensure stable operation.  I found that I better heed the warning and reboot, because my Quad core PC with 3 GB of RAM would turn into a brick that barely functioned. This is really, really annoying when you are in the middle of doing something and suddenly you have to interrupt your work to reboot the computer... oh and saving your work takes about 10 times as long since the computer suddenly doesn't want to function.  I went through tech support and they had me try a lot of different fixes, including doing a complete uninstall and reinstall of the product. Doing a reinstall actually seemed to make things better for a few days and then suddenly Norton 360 decided it was time to start failing at random intervals again.  I looked on message boards and found that some people claimed that there might be a corrupt file on your system that Norton was scanning and failing on.  The problem with that claim is that is 1) Reinstalling the product and doing a ""comprehensive"" scan didn't cause a failure so I don't think that is really the root cause and 2) even if that was the root cause, if a security product like Norton is going to crash when it finds a corrupt file, then exactly what value does the product provide?  Do you really want to go on a witch hunt for corrupt files on your computer every few days when Norton starts failing on you?  BOTTOM LINE: I wish I could recommend the product, but I CANNOT RECOMMEND.  It simply is DEFECTIVE.  When it works, it works great, but it is NOT STABLE and I believe that any installation of it WILL EVENTUALLY START CRASHING EVEN IF IT SEEMS TO WORK AT FIRST.  If you decide to buy anyway, here are a few notes:  - By default eavesdropping protection is turned off. You can enable it via the settings page. I saw in a professional review that they really recommended turning this feature on.  - You need to ensure that any other virus or firewall programs that you have installed are fully uninstalled before installing this product. Having multiple competing products installed can really mess up your system. I used the Norton removal tool from their web site to fully remove the trial version of Norton Internet Security that I was using prior to installing this software.  - If you are uncertain about this product, download the free trial from symantec first, but note that my problems with the product didn't show up until about day 20 of having it installed.  - If you choose to download the full version of the software from symantec, they place a copy of the full version under C:\ProgramData\Symantec Temporary Files on Windows Vista. Just grab a copy of the software and back it up. This way you don't have to pay to have an ""extended download period"". Or just keep a copy of the trial version around since it allows you to activate it using the product key that the symantec store gives you.  - If you are deciding between purchasing the shipped package from Amazon or Symantec, I would choose Amazon in a heart beat. Amazon customer service rocks. You also could probably download the trial version from symantec, buy the package from Amazon, and then just enter the product code from the Amazon package in the trial software once the Amazon package arrives.",823

6974.0,463,4.0,"I like to work with a fair amount of video. Over the years I've mostly cobbled together various sets of freeware software programs to meet my needs. When I got a chance to try this top-of-the-line Cyberlink suite I thought it be a great opportunity to have all my needs met by a single program. Sadly that wasn't the result.  I'll start off with how installation went.  Feel free to skip ahead if that doesn't interest you.  The suite boasts an impressive number of file formats that it can both import and export. However a huge and glaring omission is real media format. Maybe it's because RealPlayer isn't as big as it used to be, maybe it's a licensing cost issue, but whatever the case this program cannot do ANYTHING with real media files. That right there was a major crimp in what I was getting his program for.  So from the outset, I have to use a separate program to convert too and from that format which somewhat negates having a single suit.  Not the end of the world, but just be advised if your needs are similar to mine.  ***Installation***  To give you an idea what to expect, I have a year old computer with a core i7 3.4Ghz, 6 GB RAM, and 750 GB HD so if you're computer is slower some of this may take longer.  The installation is somewhat tedious; there could be a lot of streamlining done.  I started the main suite install at 4:30 PM and it finished at 4:43 PM.  You are treated to a number of different popups including DOS boxes that appear and close; it's just a polish thing but they should have been minimized IMHO.  It also starts a couple of distinct installers including installing a down rev version of QuickTime which has security issues and may leave your system at risk.  I'd suggest you update QuickTime manually immediately after install.  It also installs WaveEditor which can be used to edit sound.  So after this you're done right?  Nope, you still have the bonus content packages on the other CD.  Again, each one has to be installed separately.  I began installing the holdiay, romance, and vacation packs at 4:45 PM and was done by 4:54 PM.  However, each one requires you to fill in your name, company, and the directory.  If you're installing to a custom directory like I was, it's a mild annoyance.  It's also kind of odd it asks for a company as the license terms say it's for personal use only.  So anyway, after all this was done I had two new startup items I didn't want, APSDaemon.exe and QuickTime, set to start at computer boot.  I killed them both with RevoUninstaller (free) and there were no ill effects.  So I was ready to go?  Nope, not yet!  I had to download a 164 MB patch for the program.  Download was no problem.  You also get LabelPrint 2.5 which is an awesome little program to print CD/DVD jewel case labels as well as labels for your disk.  Please DO NOT put paper labels on your discs.  They look nice I know, but if they're not absolutely perfectly centered they can throw off the weight on the CD/DVD and potentially make the disc die sooner.  A marker made specifically made to write on CD/DVDs is the safest way.  LightScribe is probably safe too.  Anyway, it's not on the CDs, that'd be too easy, you instead have to go to the website on the card provided in the box, enter your name, email, and PowerDirector CD code to get to the link to download it and get your activation code.  After that, you can download the software (only about 37.82 MB); so then you have to enter name, company, directory again, and the new code you got for it, THEN IT ASKS YOU TO REGISTER entering your name and email AGAIN.  Finally I could start up PowerDirector.  Guess what?  It asks me to register with my name and email as well.  I'd normally not complain too much about a long install process, and it didn't take that long in terms of minutes, but it was so much less automated than it could have been it was like installing something from a decade ago.  I did however like the use of CD key instead of online activation because I travel.  It seems to be fine if you don't want to register, which is great if you have to install with no Internet connection.  ***PowerDirector***  ""Internet Connection   The import/export of some media formats may require activation via an Internet connection. Activation is fast, easy, and free. ""  First off, I mentioned that it seems you can use the software just fine without an Internet connection.  The only caveat, you do need to online register some of the file conversion formats like MPEG-2 (for DVDs) or MP4 files or you're stuck with a 30 day trial.  Activation was instantaneous and worked fine.  Just be aware and open any file types when you have an Internet connection and you should be fine.  When you start the program you're met with a splash screen. I've uploaded a photo of it to the images for this product. Basically it just gives you the option to use a handholding mode instead of the full program if you'd like. Easy mode might not be a bad idea starting out, because the program can be daunting to look at it first.  I'll upload a photo of the Full Feature Editor so you can see it.  You can easily enter Easy mode with a click of the little top hat icon (middle left) from inside the Full Feature Editor.  Importing videos is quite easy and they'll show up in the little library in the upper left-hand corner. Once you've got them there you can perform various actions on. One of the features I liked was the scene detection, however it can sometimes be hit and miss. For example on one episode from a TV show the software detected 105 scenes; on a 3 min. video clip from the web it detected 129 scenes. I loved that I could extract the audio from the clip very easily simply by right clicking it and telling it to extract audio.  Extremely useful if you need to pull your child's singing/piano/etc. out of a video to put alongside other images.  Once you're working with a video you can do a mind boggling number of corrections and tweaks to it.  Some of the features include enhancements, anti-shaking, increased back lighting, and removing noise from video/audio.  You can even flip the video into reverse with a few clicks.  It wasn't hard to split the audio from the video and I was easily able to run a video in reverse with the sound playing forwards.  You also have access to literally dozens of animation overlays (e.g. one adds hearts floating on the screen) that you can add.  Many appear to be from older versions of PowerDirector and duplicate each other.  However, there are enough to play with and the templates even allow for some level of modification themselves.  You also have access to directorZone which says it's free and allows you to download more of them.  I've not had time to try out this feature, but I'll certainly be poking around there later.  The software promises to output to nearly any file type and while technically true it's slightly misleading.  There are a number of devices the program recognizes and can output video to, but don't expect to be able to tweak the formats much; if you have a 2nd or 3rd tier video player that you'd like to convert video for directly the chances are this suite can't do it for you.  There just aren't enough options with respect to aspect ratio, audio bitrate, etc. to be precise enough.  On the up side though, you may be able to convert that stubborn web clip to a format that's close enough your video player's conversion software on your computer will be able to read it and convert to your device.  I don't have a BlueRay burner so that was out, but it had no problems at all with burning normal DVDs.  You can even burn VideoCDs if you have a friend who has an ancient computer without a DVD drive.  As with the rest of the program, there's a multitude of different options to pick including the choice from a couple of dozen menu styles, menu structures, and more.  It may be a bit overwhelming at times, but you can get pretty close to exactly what you want if you tweak enough.  ***Other Software***  Label Print 2.5 is a great little piece of software. It not only lets you print the inside and outside covers for your jewel case, but also even a menu for the inside face. This is handy if you're creating some sort of mix CD or a DVD for you on a list out the chapters.  WaveEditor is an audio manipulation program very similar to the excellent free software program called Audacity. I found it extremely intuitive to use and it was able to do some interesting effects on music such as making the room seem wider or deeper. All in all a very cool little program.  It's supposed to be able to export to WAV, MP3, M4A, and WMA, while it worked on 3 of the 4 I couldn't ever get MP3 to export correctly.  I'm hoping that's fixed in a later patch.  Until then you may have to save it as a .wav then convert using another program.  There are a number of free converters out there.  ***Conclusions***  I wish I could say this is the end-all suite you would need, but the omission of real media support at least for me hurts it. Cyberlink could improve their installation package to make the process easier and more streamlined, but I do appreciate the fact that I don't have to log into the Internet to validate the copy if I'm on the road (with the exception of 1x for certain file type support) which is a big plus for me.  For the budding armature video enthusiast who takes all the photos at the family events and then sends out DVDs to everybody at the holidays this is an excellent and comprehensive suite.  Just a note, there are some cheaper variations of this software so you may want to look at those if you don't need all the file types and all the bells and whistles.

8466.0,545,4.0,"DO YOU NEED TO FILE STATE TAX? Make sure you get a state version if you do, or federal only if you don't.  This review is for TuboTax 2013 Deluxe for Federal Returns. Fortunately I live in Texas and there is no state income tax so I don't have to worry about the state portion.  TurboTax has had its share of issues but I came back to it because it does seem to be the best there is, but I'm knocking off a star because of the history of issues I've had with the program in previous years (like it not calculating tax correctly until I deleted some assets and then re-entered them). However, I was a little shocked to read that it requires 515MB of HD space PLUS up to 1.5GB more if Microsoft .NET 4 if not installed (Mac is only 360MB). Wow! That could be over 2GB of HD to do taxes. How inefficient we have become, bat at least HD space is cheap nowadays.  The system requirements specifically mention Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7/8 but not Windows 8.1. When I installed it on my Windows 8.1 64-bit machine, installation (mid Jan 2014) seemed to go well without any problems. When it checked for updates, it found 4 updates and they all seemed to install properly... so no major install issues for me (unlike a few years ago).  NOTE: Deluxe will do a Schedule C just fine, but it may not provide as much help as the Home & Business version. If you have been doing taxes yourself for awhile then you might not need to pay the extra money for the additional help.  I will update this review as I continue to use the product.  Pros: * Price includes federal E-File * Overall, probably the best tax program there is * Does not say it works on Windows XP 64-bit (but does with 32-bit XP with SP 3+) (anyone even use XP 64-bit anyway?) * Works on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Vista and Windows 7/8/8.1 * Deluxe version can do a Schedule C for the self-employed - but it doesn't provide as much guidance as the Home & Business edition * Claims that your return will be accurate, guaranteed* (with some fine print)  Cons: * Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)? * Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets * Might take over 2GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements * I'm not happy with the reports I've read indicating saying that Intuit lobbies Congress to keep taxes overly complicated, presumably so they can make more money from sales of their tax software.  WARNING ABOUT THE ONLINE VERSION (DOES NOT APPLY TO DESKTOP VERSION):  * Intuit has removed the ability to do Schedule D and E in TurboTax Online Deluxe (you need Premier) * Intuit has removed the ability to do Schedule C and F in TurboTax Online Deluxe (you need Home & Business)",530

2470.0,207,5.0,"I will tell you right now what makes this piece of software one of a kind.  Most (other) language learning software is based on templates. They have a single template for your learning needs and they just fill the blanks for each different language. That's just like having a single universal template on how to ""drive"" and then hoping to fill the blanks for a car, a bike, a truck and a tank, no matter how different they actually are.  Fluenz is different. Even though they probably follow similar scenarios for the different languages, it's downright obvious that each lesson was created from scratch according to the language's specific traits and difficulties.  All the explanations you'll find in Fluenz French are there for a reason, and that reason belongs to the specific language you are learning. What may need 10 minutes of explanation in one language, may take no time in another.  Something else Fluenz gets right is that they teach you how to say ideas in the new language, not only words and grammar, but whole ideas. That's what you need for fluency. I've been learning languages for quite a while, English is not even my native language, and you can trust me when I tell you that having to construct phrases in your head putting grammar rules and words together every time you speak will take you nowhere.  Finally, perhaps irrelevant at first sight but unmistakably important a few hours later: it has the right ambiance. It has nice background music, i.e. it doesn't feel mechanic or boring.

4275.0,282,1.0,"I believed the hype from Microsoft that Windows 7 was 'better' or 'fixed', 'more stable' ... whatever, so I bought it. First it is sooooo different from XP that it is difficult to navigate. I had to search the internet for instructions to do the simplest of tasks.  I've been running 7 for about 3 or 4 months. I get a blue screen of death about every week or two. The most recent example was yesterday morning. I started to upload a youtube video, went away to have breakfast and came back to a blue screen of death. It's not like I was doing anything complicated, just one IE window open and one upload happening. I'm so disappointed.  Speaking of Internet Explorer, it crashes more than in XP.

It is very powerful.  You can basically search by street to any location in the USA and Canada plus it also has street level coverage of Mexico.  It is easy to use.  You can type in a street or just click on the map.  You can put in start and end locations and MapPoint will map it all out for you so you can streamline those travel plans.

This is great for business users so you can target certain products to certain areas.

7217.0,481,3.0,"Or like me they will find themselves tolerating over time by ignoring it's most obnoxious features.  I've been running Windows 8 upgrade for the last couple of days and wanted to give my initial impressions of the latest Microsoft OS, as someone that's been using Windows forever i.e. Win 3.11;it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be and then again not as good as it could be.  First, I ran the compatibility checker of course and it said all hardware was compatible and only had a couple of software problems like it said I had to uninstall security essentials and wireshark not compatible. Not bad I thought. First impressions are important and the Windows 8 upgrade setup program didn't give a good first impression. It's more confusing that the older Win7 installer for experienced user. I couldn't tell if I could install on separate partition since the only options were erase everything or upgrade everything. And a WARNING if you plan on keeping Windows 7 around in case you are not sure if you want to stick with Windows 8 don't run the installer inside Windows because it will automatically upgrade Windows 7 to Windows 8! Later I figured out you can get the more familiar win 7 installer,if you boot directly from the DVD that is, where it lets you choose what partition to install on and let's you erase, create new partitions and do a clean install. Anyways, I did a dual boot install just to play it safe and keep Win7 around if needed. After finishing the install ,which didn't really seem much faster than Win7, and actually I thought it locked up at one point but it was hard to tell with the new plain square logo which doesn't even pulsate anymore like Win7 did when you booted.  After the upgrade completed, I found out that my wireless didn't work. That's right even though it said my wireless was compatible it didn't work and I just got yellow exclamation next to it. I was about to give up but I figured I just try the trick I did when Vista first came out which is use another wireless usb stick to connect to the Internet and see if windows could find any drivers for it and sure enough that worked,so much for an improvement over Win7 in that regard.  The first time you log into Windows 8 it plays a video showing you how to use Windows by moving your mouse to the edges. You know the GUI is unintuitive when they have to show a video just so you can figure out how to use the new OS GUI! If you don't want to waste time fumbling around trying to figure out where everything went and disappeared to learning the Win+X shortcut is essential! Actually, this is the first Windows version where I've actually used the keyboard more than my mouse since some things now take too many steps i.e. like shutting down or are near impossible to do. I got stuck a couple of times in some of the new metro apps took over my entire screen and I wasn't able to quit or get back to the desktop! Tip: if this happens to you just hit the Windows key on your keyboard. If you really can't stand the new GUI you can recreate everything just like in Win7 for the most part and stay in the classic desktop instead of the new metro start screen. I think the two things that are going to annoy most people is the lack of the Start button and inability to boot directly to the old classic desktop instead of Metro. I know it still bugs me!  All the programs and games I normally use in Windows 7 seem to work just fine in Windows 8. If it doesn't you can try right clicking to troubleshoot compatibility. My WEI score is the same in Win8 as it was in Win7 so seems no performance change according to that benchmark. Seems to be way more stable than Vista or even Win7 when it first came out. Gotten a lot fewer crashes than when Win7 first came out. My problematic wireless usb, which I mentioned isn't compatible, even though Windows 8 says it is has been causing the most problems even causing a BSOD!  Another thing I didn't like is that there was like a 200MB update as soon as I first logged in and unlike Win7, Win8 rudely rebooted my computer in the middle of a browsing session and didn't warn me or give me option to postpone the reboot. At least on Mac OS X there is option to restore all your windows and browser to the way you had them, even after a reboot. Some of the things I do like about it so far is that you can now read pdf files without having to install acrobat just like mac os has always been able to, and IE now comes with Flash already built in. It's always annoying having to install all those basic programs.  I really like the new task manager, it gives you a lot more info than before and Microsoft now has something that even mac os does which is very cool and needed by people nowadays with bandwidth caps, metered connections. If your right click your wireless it'll tell you how much bandwidth you have used. Now that I think about it a lot of the new stuff in Win8 seems like it's copied directly from OS X. For example, there are no games included now and Microsoft basically forces you to get minesweeper and solitare from the app store now! The icons on the metro screen are just like a cross between the widgets in OS X dashboard and launchpad. It's looks like they also copied the Xbox GUI and brought it into windows.  Smartscreen, which caught me off guard first time I tried installing something I downloaded from the Internet, is Microsoft's version of Gatekeeper which does the same thing on OS X. It get's very annoying if you don't have an Internet connection because it will appear that the installation program is frozen until it figures out you aren't connected! So that is one of the new security features they added to Win8. Secure boot is another one that is causing uproar in the Linux community since it causes headaches if you want to dual boot Windows and Linux.  Biggest disappointments, from a technical point of view, is that Win8 isn't 64bit only like we thought it would be a couple of years ago. Even Mac OS X is now fully 64-bit although that upset the people that couldn't upgrade their older Macs. Also, the Achilles heel of Windows, the registry, because it's too easy to corrupt and render Windows useless, is still there along with the winsxs problem. The WinSxs problem can grow out of hand and eat up all your disk space! I've been saying since XP ,why can't they include .net into windows instead of making you download it like Java? A couple of programs I tried to run said I needed the .net 2 or 3 mainly Steam games and so I had to download another 20-200MB file for that to work and you have to be connected to net to download it since there is no standalone version.  Another big letdown is that only the server version got the new filesystem ReFS, win8 only got storage spaces, which is more software raid. Microsoft has been promising a new improved filesystem several Windows versions back. I think the hardcore power users are going to have to accept the fact that the future of both Windows and Mac OS X is going to become and more geared to the iPod and Xbox crowd with their simplistic touch GUI and interface. This is also the group I'm guessing will have a more favorable view of the new GUI changes. I guess I'd probably be way more impressed if I had a touch capable PC since a lot of the new stuff seems to be geared towards that? I mean the command line is still there somewhere but it's hidden pretty good just like in OS X. Only thing I've really seen for geeks is something that macs and linux have been able to do for a long time already which is run the operating system from an external or usb stick, called windows to go but you need enterprise version for that.  As far as improvements in performance go, I haven't really seen any performance increases or disc space savings to warrant being in a rush to upgrade. My boot times are pretty much the same as with Win7 but then again I have an SSD drive , so Windows has already been pretty fast using that. In fact, the upgrade installer said I needed to free up at least 20GB of space min to even start the upgrade! Still no less than Win7 and XP only needs 10GB. Personally, I think I'll stick with Win8 it since I need to do a clean install on my SSD anyways since I have a whole bunch of old Windows 7 updates hogging up my SSD (the WinSXS problem I mentioned above) and haven't really had any major show stoppers so far like Vista or even Win7 when it first came out.  Finally, you need to get the media center upgrade, to play DVD's, otherwise you can't even play dvd's without installing powerdvd or some other program! I think this new version of Windows would be a lot more popular if it wasn't for Microsoft arbitrarily removing the start button so users are forced to use the new metro start screen whether you want to or not!  Finally they did add a new option to disk cleanup that few will notice that addresses the WinSXS issue: This is a MAJOR improvement over Windows 7, but I bet they only did it for Windows 8 because of all the ranting about WinSxS. This is a fantastic news for SSD users!  You can find Disk Cleanup by typing: WIN Key and start typing Disk Cleanup Click the Disk Cleanup's ""Clean up System Files"" Button in the middle of the screen. Check the box for Previous Windows Installation(s) Click ""OK"" button and click the ""Delete"" Confirmation button. Now, only if they included a registry cleaner! and fixed the start button and booting into metro issues this would be a solid OS upgrade!",989

598.0,47,5.0,"A First Look - Mac OS X 10.3 ""Panther"" Tim Robertson Publisher/Owner, Columnist, MacRelevant Friday, 10/24/03 As the masses await the Fed-Ex truck to deliver to their eager hands a copy of the latest Mac OS X release from Apple, Panther, MyMac.com presents our early, first-look at the eagerly awaiting OS. First impressions: Wow, this thing is fast! Running 10.3 on an Apple Macintosh G5 1.8GHz, we noticed a huge speed boost to almost every finder-level task. Opening windows, scrolling large directories, accessing other machines over the network, you name it, it seemed faster. But lets take a look at some of the unique features in Panther. Expos&eacute;. This is a very, very cool new feature that I am simply in love with. What does it do? Well, for the uninitiated, it gives you instant access to any open window from any program, including the finder. What Expos&eacute; does is makes every open window shrink on your screen, and you simply click the window you want to spring to the front. So what's the big deal, you ask? Unlike the old Application window in Mac OS 9, which will only show you the applications running, this shows you all your open windows. So if you have three Safari windows open (I never do, I am in love with Tabs now) this will let you see every window. What's more, when you put your cursor over the mini-windows, the name of the window is displayed. You really have to experience Expos&eacute; live to appreciate just how much it is going to change the way you use the Mac OS. The only drawback for me is that it does not show any windows you may have minimized to the dock. To access Expos&eacute;, you first set it up in your system preferences pane. For myself, I have Expos&eacute; activate for all windows if I put my cursor in the upper-right hand of my screen. If I put my cursor in the lower right, only the front application (including the Finder) will show. By default, three F-Keys are also set to do the same. Even cooler, when you click F11, all open windows move out of the way to reveal the desktop, and stay out of the way until you call them back. If you have a multi-button mouse, you can also assign mouse buttons to do the same. I personally use my extra mouse buttons to launch applications, but I could set it up so that the scroll wheel button moves everything out of the way for quick access to the desktop. Expos&eacute; is one of those application that, like I said, better experienced than explained. I cannot get over how useful this is to how I would with my Mac. If it were not part of the OS, I would call this the next Killer App for the Mac. Heads-up Application Switcher. This is yet another way to switch between applications without using Expos&eacute; or the Dock. Mac OS 9 also had it. All you do is hold down the command-tab keys to bring up a heads-up display of the open applications. You continue to hold down the command (Apple) key while you ""Tab"" to the application you want. I used the same method in Mac OS 9 for years, and fell in love with it. It is one of the most missed features for me in Mac OS X. Welcome Back Labels! Yes, you can, finally, use labels in Mac OS X. But this, my friends, is labels on steroids! Labels work in all three views, Icons, List, or Columns. In Icon view, the label is a rich full color, rounded around the text. The icon itself is not colored, as it was is Mac OS 9. In List view, the color again does not apply to the icon, but to the entire line of the item labeled, so that the rounded colored bar extends across the entire windows. The same is true for Column view, but when you have clicked the labeled folder, the triangle keeps the label color. These may seem like not such a big deal, but they really are. Many, many people used labels to help find items, or to mark items that are of special importance, and it is a much-welcomed re-introduction to the Mac OS. Like Expos&eacute;, you really have to see the new labels in action to appreciate them. Many people are all up in arms about the brushed metal look, which is used in all the iLife applications, now being carried throughout the finder as well. These worries are unfounded, in my opinion. While I actually like the look, you can toggle it off if you wish. You do, however, loose some of the new functionality of finder windows if you do. Rather than having application folders, favorite folders, document folder etc&Eacute; at the top of each window, they are all now on the far left of your open windows. And they are all customizable. Personally, I think the new windows in Panther are a welcome improvement over the previous OS X windows. One neat, though small, new feature is Apple put the often-used ""Software Update"" in the Apple menu. Clicking this simply opens the Software Update pane, but it does save one step in the process. A small update, sure, but one I have already gotten used to. And as the Apple menu is unchanged system-wide, you are always one click away from it. Fast Switching. What is this? Well, if you share your computer with others, you will probably want to have multiple users accounts set up. A staple since the first release of Mac OS X, it was easy to switch to a different user. Now, however, it is even faster. When you activate ""Enable Fast User Switching"" in the ""Accounts"" pane in System Preferences, it puts the current users name in the upper right hand corner of your screen. It also puts in all the other names of any other user of your Mac. In my case, I have a ""Basic"" in which the system is basically as it would be fresh from the store. I also have one for my wife (even though she uses her own iMac, not my G5) and one named ""Kids"" which is for, obviously, my kids. (All they can do is create pictures in Illustrator or Photoshop, type up letters, and use Safari with bookmarks my wife and I approve, all others all deleted.) So what happens when you click one of those names? You entire screen rotates; bring that user to the front. If the name is password protected, in brings up the log-on screen. And best of all, you can leave your account just as it is, with all the applications running, and switch users. When you switch back, everything is just as you left it. This is amazing technology I don't think enough people utilize. All in all, Panther is a great OS. Of course, there will be some applications that will not run correctly and need updating, but that is true for any major OS upgrade. I am very, very pleased with Mac OS X 10.3, and think that for those with a newer machine, you will appreciate the added speed benefits and stability. The new features all work really well, and I look forward to delving deeper into Panther in the coming months. Tim Robertson",429

This is the 14th year I've used TurboTax for our state and federal returns, and this version is as good as any Intuit has offered (some years have offered better user experiences that others).  Of the many changes that personal computing and online services have brought to our household, one of the things I appreciate most is the taming of the onerous chore of tax preparation into something much simpler. Tax time before TurboTax used to be a three-day long parade of headache-inducing calculations and HOPING I had all the correct forms. TurboTax has turned three days of extended misery into a couple hours of compressed misery...but misery that is free of anxiety over math error and interpreting IRS instructions.  Intuit had rough period in the early 2000s with privacy and functionality in TurboTax (and a STINGY approach to how many users could prepare taxes from a single copy). Happily, those days are far in the past.  This version allows you to prepare up to five federal returns. Installation was issue free and updating (since January) has been were painless on a Windows 7 machine. Because I had data from last year's edition on my computer already, our personal data was already filled in, and it smartly queried about the same sources of income and interest and deductions/credits as last year. It also easily handled two major changes in our filing situation.  With all of my tax documents at hand, and a moderately complex 1040 filing scenario, I was finished in less than an hour. Sweet. Error checking was painless, and --72 hours before the deadline-- efiling the payments due were also problem-free. Note that federal filing is free, but state efiling cost $19.95.

9130.0,584,4.0,"I've been using PowerDVD for years, upgrading nearly every year when new versions are released. It's a powerful application for viewing videos, DVDs and Blu-rays, offering a huge arsenal of features... more features then any other video player I own. For me, it's easily my favorite player for viewing blu-ray movies on my computer as it does so perfectly, with no issues... unlike other programs I have that claim to play blu-ray movies (but don't).  PowerDVD also acts as a library system for your videos as it allows you to browse all your movies and select which one to watch. It's a good idea that personally I'm not 100% pleased with. It seems to me it's in constant scan mode, searching my computer endlessly for videos. I haven't found a setting to turn this option off, so the result can be a slight lag when browsing of my movie directories, despite the fact that my computer is running on SSD storage. I also hate the fact that it's constantly searching my computer for videos without my permission as I feel like it's an invasion of privacy. This has been a problem since at least the last version, likely going back to at least version 12, so it's nothing new.  Being the most powerful and feature-filled video player I own also has it's drawbacks... all my other video apps will pop open a video clip instantly and begin playing... PowerDVD takes a bit longer, which makes it a poor choice for a quick video player.  I will note that I have had no issues with file associates being hijacked by PowerDVD as several other reviewers have complained about. I don't remember the procedure for installing it, but I do always use 'custom'  or 'advanced' options, so possibly the file association issue occurs when people choose to do a quick installation.  My biggest complaint for this version is the lack of improvements. For the first time, my keyboard's media buttons such as pause and the volume control work perfectly with PowerDVD. Aside from that, for me at least, I have found absolutely no difference in how I use the program from version 13, and even version 12. It doesn't seem any faster or slower then previous versions either.  Overall, PowerDVD 14 is a great program for people who want a full-featured video player. For those looking for a simple and cheap way to view video clips... this is not it. I would also recommend anyone with a copy of PowerDVD 11 or newer to check into the improvements, as there aren't a whole lot to make this a worthwhile upgrade.",1152
1230.0,81,5.0,"Power and layout are the two big advantages to this USB hub.  This hub has the power to drive not only the full USB 2.0 rated current capacities, but beyond.  It means that, for example, one of its USB ports can power up a Western Digital Passport external USB hard disk drive which is very unusual for a hub.  Since the idea of buying a USB hub is to move functions away from your limited number of computer USB ports (especially a notebook computer!), the more of those functions it can move, the better.  And this device will let you plug that Passport in where it is out of your way.  The device is well laid out, too.  The power, input USB port, and three of the seven USB output ports are on the back end of the device (above where it says ""T7Hub"" in the photograph) which makes cable routing easier for ""permanent"" devices like printers, scanners, etc., since the cables for those come from behind it (and don't clutter the front).  And that leaves the other four USB output ports on the front side where they are easy to access, like for a memory stick, or for that WD passport drive to do a monthly software backup.

2279.0,172,5.0,"I'm going to do a short review here and say that Corel has some advantages over Photoshop for photomanipulation or editing. Where Photoshop Elements (a fine piece of software) has you estimate or use your monitor and judgment for fixing photos, CorelDraw's Photo suite has an Integrated Image Adjustment Lab --and it tells you how you are going to affect the data on a RAW image, losing image quality by various adjustments. Instead of eyeballing what you are doing, you can retain maximum detail in highlights and shadows using their sliders and suggestions. When you exceed the limits and start to lose detail, an exclamation point crops up on the slider, showing you that you have degraded the photo quality. This is probably the best photo editing software I've used for that reason.  While I like the competing PhotoShop Elements for ease of use and the fun effect, CorelDraw has more professional features and the interface for photoediting is full of information yet easy to use.

449.0,26,1.0,"In its early years, this operating system was one of the most unsatisfactory I have ever used --- including DOS, Win 3.1, Windows 95 and Windows 98.  Aside from being incompatible with older hardware, XP Home Edition crashed frequently --- especially if you often work with several windows open at once as I do. This was particularly unhelpful. As a writer, I was forced to save documents no less than once for each new sentence, and at touchy moments, literally every few words.  Most important, the program is highly susceptible to viruses and hackers. Preventing these two problems requires expensive add-on software and hardware.  True enough, the built-in firewall OUGHT to work. But in my case, hackers got in anyway -- four times in six months. With this software, I suffered repeated break ins, the last of which cost me some primary data and several of my original poems. Even installing service pack 2 did not help.  After the last go-round, I was forced to hire an expensive data recovery guru --- another story in itself --- but was still unable to recover everything lost.  Throughout this six-month nightmare, I repeatedly reinstalled the XP program, including, more than once, service pack 2. That, however, didn't plug the security leaks. My computer was completely compromised. In the end, I had to junk the machine all together.  In my experience, Mac and Linux operating systems are both far superior.  Now I've got one Windows machine --- a laptop purchased in early 2007 at or around the release of Service Pack 3 --- to run a BioFeedback program whose authors, unfortunately, had not created a Linux version.  Admittedly, Microsoft's final XP service pack seems to have plugged XP's most serious security holes.

PhotoDirector 6 fits that need very well.  Importing photos is a simple process and rather than a bunch of obscure icons on a palette, PhotoDirector arranges their functions by general task and as a result, workflow is much easier. There are tools for retouching blemishes, taking care of redeye, enhancing skin and eyes and there's even a tool that lets you reshape a persons body (to get rid of holiday pounds, I suspect).  Two things that impressed me were the High Dynamic Range (HDR) and panorama functions. Both tools made it very easy to create HDR and panorama photos and did a good job identifying photos that were not appropriate for the shot.

I have had mixed feelings about the Corel versions as they tend to be slower loading with a fairly large system footprint and in the more recent versions almost as cumbersome and confusing as Photoshop.  This current offering continues to suffer from those flaws (but only enough to cost them one star in the rating) though still offering the features that I have always valued in Paintshop. The tool is easy enough to use, once you pass the initial learning curve, and priced to make it accessible to the non-corporate user. Installation was easy and uneventful, startup on my dual-core system was slow as expected, but ran smoothly once up.  One feature that continues to improve over the years is the shape fitting selection (something that used to be the shape or outline wizard and is now being called Magic Move), still not perfect and does require a little help with touch-up, but leaps and bounds over what used to be required to cut and move a non-standard shape within a picture. I still love the layering (originally discovered it in Photoshop, and loved when introduced to PaintShop).

Since Word, Outlook and Excel are enterprise standards, it is important to have a compatible office suite. With Wordperfect, this is simply not the case. Wordperfect chokes on the simplest VB scripts, is not compatible with Office tables and macros and such a foreign interface that any reasonably qualified office worker would find it a hassle. It is an XML-based word processor, however, and this is good for writers/workers who are also capable XML programmers. I have never had a publisher, editor or evaen a college course that allows the WP format in any setting. The reveal codes is a neat gimmick but it is only helpful because formatting Wordperfect documents is so difficult to start with (I am speaking as a secretary and publisher myself). If you want your office production to operate smoothly and easily for all of your workers, WordPerfect is not an option. The bottom line is that WP is not easy compatible, or as thorough as any version of Microsoft Office. If you care about compatibility and your company's bottom line, spend an extra $50 and get the suite from Microsoft.  On the other hand, if you have no need for compatibility or efficient production, get Wordperfect, it is smooth, good-looking and is well-supported by Corel who continue to improve as a company (owned by Microsoft).",671
2970.0,155,3.0,"It's not a one-star product.  It can't be.  The interoperability with Office 2003 and 2007 alone makes it higher than that.  After all, people who get Office 2008 are commonly those who have used the Windows version of Office and need to continue working with those files.  Say what you will about iWork, it's not perfect in that arena.  When dealing with school work and business assignments that call for these features, it's just not acceptable to deal with anything but the best, and in those arenas, Office reigns supreme.  A lot of this is based on my personal experience.  It really boils down to four things.  OFFICE 2008 IS EXTREMELY SLOW.  I don't even mean slightly laggy.  I mean SLOW.  TO the point you wonder if anyone did any QA on it before releasing it.  They're not even bloated apps either, not even Entourage, so it's boggling as to why the apps are as slow as they are.  Excel is by far the worst offender in the bunch.  OFFICE 2008 IS EXTREMELY BUGGY.  I speak more to Word and Excel than Powerpoint or Entourage.  Excel is known to lock up after a fashion.  Word has frozen on me on more than one occasion, the latest being right at the closing stages of a book I'd written (obviously unacceptable).  OFFICE 2008 IS EXTREMELY CONVOLUTED.  If you've used 2003, you know it's a matter of memorizing toolbar and menu positions.  If you've used 2007 you know it's getting familiar with the Ribbon, mostly.  2008, I don't know what they were thinking.  The Toolbox just takes all of the needed features and bulks them under a clunky structure that makes it difficult to get to the simplest of tasks.  I know they plan to fix this with 2011, and I certainly hope they take note of what they did with 2007 and 2010, because 2008 feels archaic even now.  OFFICE 2008 IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE.  Given it doesn't include a full flavor of Outlook, and how clunky, buggy, and slow it really is, and given the fact that iWork is significantly lower, it's confusing to me why Microsoft feels the need to price this so high.  IN summary, I recommend it for its interoperability, but ONLY if you need that.  If you're just trying to compile docs for school and your own files, choose iWork instead.  The only thing you lose is mail, but the built in Mail app is more than enough for the majority of applications.

After looking in vain for an icon that might say ""Add to timeline"" or something, I decided I had to move it from the thumbnail list into the timeline, which I did.

Now, how to convert it to a suitable format? No obvious shortcuts for that. There are options to create DVD, Blu-Ray, etc. There's Batch Convert, but you have to select files to convert. Does this mean it'll be trimmed as I want? Dunno. ... Ah, here it is - Share tab, then Create Video File. OK, there are plenty of formats. Good.

5166.0,349,4.0,"Media Expressions Platinum 3 is great entry level product for anyone who loves to work with their photos, organize them, add special effects, etc. The software is very intuitive and makes it easy to get around to different features - I skipped the manual and dug right in. I've always been really intimidated with Corel (not to mention it's a lot more expensive), so Media Expressions is a great alternative.  With Media Expressions, you can import photos from a variety of sources like camera, PCs, mobile devices, etc. There are a lot of great and very easy ways to edit photos, tag individuals, change brightness, contrast, etc., fix flaws, and the list goes on. I'm a big social media junkie, so I enjoyed the feature that lets you upload your creations directly to Facebook, Flickr, Twitter and so on. You can also add some pretty nifty special effects, create movies and much more.  I'm very pleased with both the functionality and the price of Media Expressions, and look forward to doing even more with my photos.",702
450.0,26,4.0,"I recently upgraded form Windows 98 to XP on my home PC.  I use Windows 2000 at work and I have to say that XP is by far the best choice for the home PC.  I did the XP Upgrade and I must say that is was extremely easy to convert my 98 system to XP.  I takes A L-O-N-G time to do the install (a single cd, yet prepare to spend about 2 hours once you hit ""go""). MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER.... If you do nothing else to prepare for the upgrade; take the time to run the hardware & software compatibility check before you commit yourself to the install.  This is most critical & here's a good example.  The driver for my PC's modem/chipset was incompatible with XP.  This was highlighted when I ran the test and it allowed me to retrieve the updated driver before launching the upgrade.  If I had not done this, then I would have been toast.  After the upgrade I would not have been able to use my modem to access the internet to get the new driver after the fact.  So do yourself a favor, run the test, print it out, get all your patches beforehand & you'll save yourself a ton of frustration and wasted time. Other than that it's great and very easy to load.  They did a great job with the user interface and instructions.  It was a no brainer to install.  Just remeber to read everything first, run the compatibility test, print out the important stuff (it even tells you what the important stuff is!) and get your patches before you hit ""go"". Now go & dump your 5 year old OS and get up to date.",387

3572.0,227,5.0,"Amazon has just recently made Snow Leopard even more irresistible by lowering the price of the Family Pack to within range of the already discounted Single-User copy, which I""m now regretting purchasing only because there are more users in the family than me alone.  Don't be misled by much of the the hype accompanying this version--most of it concerns features that were already available on Leopard.  Yes, Expose, Spaces, and Stacks have been tweaked, but some of us never found much use for them in the first place.  The primary reason to upgrade is improved efficiency and speed. Apple has figured out how to reconfigure the OS system to optimize memory, eliminating unnecessary programs (for printers and peripheral items you'd never use), and the result is a snappier, rejuvenated computer experience.  It's not like Apple to make colorful come-ons and computer cosmetics secondary to sheer practicality, but in this case they've attended to the matters that matter most.  If you're an experienced computer-user, you've no doubt become all too sensitive to the time wasted in opening programs and large files, sending mail, multi-tasking (I wish I had a penny for every second I've sat idly in front of the screen while that darn wheel kept spinning around).  If I can save five minutes of non-productive computer time a day, the upgrade is worth several times the current price.  While I'm at it, I'll put in a plug for a nifty new storage drive that is the ""iPod"" of personal external drives--it's the Seagate Free Agent for Macs, configured to work with Time Machine and complement your desk-top instantly and, if you use the Firewire 800 connection, at twice the speed of all of the USB drives--moreover, it comes with a matching dock and leather carrying case.

We were very happy with Windows 7 and MSN email.  It has been impossible for me to get our three systems to provide the same usable function that the Windows 7 Systems provided.  Because of the password security system, and its unpredictable results when interfacing, I have had to restore the Dell Desktop, and Asus notebook to factory defaults.

Spamming your customers via their financial software that they PAID for is tacky.  Shame on you Intuit.

12359.0,215,3.0,"Microsoft MapPoint 2009 seems like overkill when it comes to personal use. I know you can get directions using it, but you can just as easily do that with MapQuest, Google Maps, Yahoo! Maps, etc. I know you can use it as a GPS program with the proper GPS hardware, but that's a fairly expensive solution when there are much more user-friendly, less expensive (and often more up-to-date) solutions readily available at any store that sells electronics. No, for personal use, MapPoint 2009 is very nearly extreme overkill.  What MapPoint 2009 will enable you to do from a business perspective is more useful. The data mapping features are welcome and well-implemented (even though the overall interface is a bit clunky, not exactly surprising for a Microsoft product, but it does work). The ability to pull and import your own statistical data could be useful to someone in a corporate environment, but again, is largely useless for a personal user. Being able to import data into MS Office applications is relatively smooth, which is probably one of the biggest strengths the software has for business users (who are already intimately familiar with MS Office; web-based mapping software is often not as obliging).  MapPoint 2009 is a decent program, if you're in the business demographic that it obviously seems to be catering too. If you're just looking for something to get driving directions, stick to Google Maps or invest in an inexpensive GPS unit. If you're looking for a way to incorporate mapping data into reports or documents, then you might want to give MapPoint 2009 (or now 2010) a closer look.",1226

10470.0,663,5.0,"Up until this year I've never used tax software, and rarely had to do my own taxes at any point in my life (once or twice with a 1040 EZ as I remember was about it.)  This year my husband reluctantly agreed to let me give it whirl after he missed a few things on our return last year, and we ended up having to pay more taxes and complete an amended return.  When I went looking at the various tax software programs and read the reviews, I decided H&R was the one for me. Married, filing jointly with some self-employment and retirement income and filing for only one state residency, ""Premium"" was what we needed to get things done.  -------------------------------  The interview questions help you through most of it, but I did get stumped a few times. Reading the help section got me through, however I did find I needed to re-do at least half a dozen things before all was said and done. This could have just been my inexperience with the whole process or not accurately interpreting the 'help' info provided.  Having everything in front of me and entering data as I went along was easy. Once the federal return is complete, the State return kind of does itself. I got a little nervous a few times thinking I'd sent in my return, but thankfully there are several checks and balances in place that won't allow that to happen.  While this wasn't what I'd call 'simple', it was easier than sitting down with sheets of paper and a booklet, trying to make sense of it all. Calculations are automatically done for you, and deductions are maximized. Questions are generally very clear and explanations as to the nuances of what things are 'covered' are concise and in layman's terms.  This software definitely helped me to maximize our deductions, and gain insight into what I can do this year to help us for next years taxes. It made seeing the bigger picture easier than it had been in the past for my husband too.  -----------------------------  The best thing about this software is the quantity and quality of information I received from doing our taxes this way. It made me think about next year, and relieved that it's likely to be a much easier process with this e-file done and in the system.  I liked that H&R's software provided us with glitch-free filing. A print and mail-in option was available (a way to save the twenty bucks on your state filing with a longer wait for a refund) , but since I heard that both my federal and state returns were accepted within 1 hour of submitting them via e-file, the twenty bucks spent on the state return was well worth it for both a quick refund and peace of mind.  I will definitely use this software next year, and recommend it to others.  -----------------------------------  UPDATE 4/8/15:  Received confirmation of acceptance of both State and Federal returns within 5 hours of filing them. Federal tax payment was taken out of my account within 8 hours of that confirmation, and we received a deposit of our refund from the State within 7 days.  I feel like this was a much more comprehensive way to to our taxes than the old paper version, and I'm relieved that next year we'll be all set to do it again using H&R!",1006

6651.0,439,1.0,"I have been using Quicken since the 2nd DOS version. I cannot understand how Intuit can mess up so consistently. Since the 2004 release, every update gets worse. This is up there with the worst of the worst. Good features that worked no longer work, little frustrating things never get fixed -- EVER! This goes on and on for years, and then more little frustrating problems get added. Over the years, I have sent Intuit a long list of items to fix. Never once have I received so much as one acknowledgement nor, to my knowledge, has one single item I have mentioned been fixed. I have not been asking for major feature additions or even enhancements. I have been asking for little things that any user would find beneficial. The irony is that I am a Software Design Engineer -- for about 30 years. So I don't send frivolous ideas.  Here are some annoying examples of the functionality that is now no longer working in 2013: Whatever category you had for your downloaded items before the 2013 version is no longer used. Quicken just seems to pick whatever it wants. In my case, everything is categorized as ""Income."" Also, if you enter in the category and memorize it, it still will not be recognized in the next download. If you rename payees, the renaming will not be seen by Quicken the next time that same payee is downloaded. If you click on a downloaded item in the bottom window that has already been Accepted, that item is no longer highlighted in the register. So getting back to it is time consuming and requires hunt and seek or search.  I wanted to have a separate paragraph for this one: speed. Or, rather, the complete lack of it. It is even slower than the 2010 edition - which was a dog. I have a 4.4Ghz hexcore Intel machine with the fastest solid state drive money can buy. I have 64Gb of very high speed DDR. Quicken is now slower than ever. I don't know what others are experiencing on older machines with slow, spinning mechanical hard drives and 1.5Ghz dual core CPUs, but it must be a special form of torture.  Now we are forced into an upgrade to keep our bank downloads. I call this extortion. The only way Intuit can get us to upgrade is to threaten to curtail downloading from our banks if we do not upgrade. Making a better user experience seems to never enter into their plans. Reporting to Intuit the problems and bugs is now so obfuscated that I do not even know how to do it. I have posted several messages to them, I thought, but they end up in some blog that generates user response. What can users do about bugs? Just ludicrous.  If you do not have to upgrade, then DO NOT. You have been warned.  (See my other reviews to know that I review a lot and have no particular bias to grind. If Intuit gets its act together I will give them a good review. One can hope.)",752
4236.0,280,3.0,"The big question for many users is ""will the 200+ dollar investment and several hours of time justified by the actual and perceived benefits of the upgrade?""  From my perspective, the answer is *possibly* as general performance is incrementally improved. Personally, it may be many months, however, before I get a suitable payback for the time I have invested during the upgrade process. Sadly, there are some annoying bugs in Windows 7 Ultimate that are having an immediate impact on my productivity.  To its credit, Microsoft did do an excellent job with its upgrade process technology that allows users to keep all of their programs and files. Basically, everything should be as you left it except for various task bar and star menu links. It reminds me of a comment made by a construction contractor faced with gutting the Pentagon in the 1990's who suggested the job was like changing a black-and-white television to a color set with no interruption in programming. This must have been no small feat for Microsoft.  My goal for the upgrade was merely to increase the performance of my already fast HP Elitebook mobile workstation with an X9100 dual-core processor and 4GB of RAM running Vista 64 bit.  I wasn't a Vista hater to begin with but I am always looking for a speed boost.  Various IT personnel with whom I have spoken and who tested Windows 7 for months before its release raved about its speedy performance.  As I continuously run a real-time full-text search application on my notebook called X1, I have taken the approach that any performance enhancement is worth the investment.  After installing Vista and then subsequently installing the graphics drivers for my Nvidia Quadra graphics card, I can say that Windows 7 is visibly faster in some aspects.  Oddly, my one performance benchmark, the 3DMark06 (below), didn't conclusively demonstrate a performance bump.  The biggest improvements thus far appears to be with opening various Microsoft applications.  While I have not timed this scientifically, the launch process appears to be about twice as fast. Other actions, such and launching a new tab in IE Explorer (i.e. new iexplorer.exe process) appears to be dramatically faster (> 3X).  In all, Windows just seems to be running faster when under high stress environments.  Some of the new window manipulation features do allow the user to save a couple of steps.  For example, one can drag an application window to the top border of the screen to have that window application maximize and fill the screen.  Similarly, one can drag a window to the right or left, causing that application window to fill  of the screen on that particular side of the desktop.  Yet, it seems that overall, Microsoft seems to be focusing more on mouse usage and less on keyboard shortcuts. Power users who work on Wall Street are trained to use keyboard shortcuts instead of the mouse in virtually all possible circumstances.  Once learning a few dozen of these keyboard shortcuts, one's productivity can increase significantly.  For some odd reason, Microsoft seems to be moving away from providing such capabilities to power users as evidenced in their release of Office 2007 where many of the most important hotkeys were changed or removed.  Likewise, in Windows 7, there are changes to the hotkey functions that will IMPEDE power users.  Some of the aesthetic features are a matter of taste.  The Personalization functionality allows for a collection of high resolution desktop pictures to change throughout the day.  Corresponding to a particular theme are system sounds so, for example, when you select American scenes them, a banjo will sound when you have an alert whereas in previous versions of Windows a beep would sound.  Vindows7 adds additional transparency capabilities to the user interface. Yet, many of these such as the transparent application window frames have dubious value as they give a cluttered appearance.  Be aware, the setup - even from Vista it is time consuming.  I have excluded steps that I felt were necessary but not critical to complete the install such as the 45 minutes needed to backup 20 GB of data on the drive. Time required for the setup (HP Elitebook Mobile Workstation):  1) 3.0 hours of research (reading reviews, speaking with IT personnel) 2) 0.5 hours choosing the appropriate version and purchasing the software 3) 0.5 hours backing up data (as a precaution) 4) 0.75 hours uninstalling conflicting HP Protect software and turning back on needed processes that I disabled 5) 1.5 hours installation time 6) 0.5 installing Windows updates immediately after installation 7) 0.5 hours installing Nvidia Quadra drivers (suggested by Windows 7 installation process 8) 1.5 customizing layout of taskbars, start menu, visual effects and other Windows setting 9) TBD - learning curve So, in total, this took up 8.75 hours of my time, which hopefully will pay off at some point.  The X1 real-time search application is my biggest processor hog by a long margin.  It is one of the reasons I purchased a very high end notebook and decided to invest in the Windows 7 Ultimate upgrade.  I can't say there is a big performance boost from that perspective.  It does seem that there are fewer hang-ups in Windows 7 than with XP or Vista, but it still happens.  Yet, when a program does hang (""application not responding"") - any program, the user finds the same annoying messages ""are you sure you really want to close the application, really?"" It is still mystifies me why there isn't a more aggressive kill function, much like what exists in old-school Unix.  In all, I would say the upgrade is worth it.  Windows 7 does appear to slightly improve performance and many enjoy the new aesthetics.

6615.0,438,5.0,"NOLO Publishing is one of the best legal publishers out there (for books and software). In addition to this Quicken Willmaker Plus software, I also have the NOLO companion book for creating a will. I have many NOLO published books, in fact.  For all those people who are afraid to create a will this will make it easy. Aside from a will, this software includes a Health Care Proxy, Power of Attorney, Living Will, Health Care Directive, and many other useful documents. The software is updateable through the website until the end of 2013. You also get a little book entitled The Legal Answer Book for Families.  The program reminded me of a Turbo Tax type of deal in which you answer the questions from screen to screen and thus, your will (or whatever document you're working on) is generated. It's very simple. The company offers good support and customer service as well as a helpful and useful website.  I can't say enough great things about NOLO.

3649.0,233,3.0,"I have the non Pro version and picked up the Pro version. Overall the core areas of the product are good. The virus protection and parental control are very good for most users.

They are not bad to have but not worth the extra cost and most people probably won't use them or know how to use them.  For the core piece of the product which is virus protection, you can't go wrong with Trend Micro. They are a very good virus company and are used in the corporate world as well. So if you are looking for a good virus software with parental controls then stick to the non Pro version.

1754.0,128,2.0,"The software does a decent job of backing up data and imaging disks. However, in my case, I bought it for its advertised Startup Recovery Manager which is supposed to allow you to restore your PC's system state in the event its startup files get corrupted. Unfortunately, it did not work as advertised. When I contacted tech support about this issue by email, I received the following response:  ""Please note that it's not possible to restore system state backup that way. In order to restore it, you need to run Acronis True Image 11 Home in Windows Environment, then choose this backup archive from Acronis Secure Zone and proceed with restoration.""  If I could start my PC in a Windows environment, I wouldn't need to restore the system state, now would I? Acronis Tech support appears to be staffed by a bunch of leftover Soviet bureaucrats who just don't get the job done.  The Secure Zone and Startup Recovery Manager flat don't work on my PC - even though Acronis says the software is compatible with Windows 2000. I spent hours testing it today. The worst news is that in a couple of instances, Startup Recovery Manager says it completed restoration of test files, when in fact, it did not. So, if you're going to rely on this product to recover your data, you'd better test it thoroughly before you actually need it.  If you just need disk imaging and data backup, this software will probably be OK. If you're looking for a comprehensive PC data recovery solution, you'll be better off looking somewhere else!",477

9485.0,604,5.0,"Everything that I said two years ago when reviewing Pro X6 is still true in Pro X7.  The software does, in fact, load much faster when opened.  (I honestly have not timed it to say that it is 30%, but I will say that it is significant and noticeable).  Also, there is over 200MB worth of content that you can download for free on Corel that supplements the software with additional brushes, images, clip art, etc.  I still love this software and still stand by my opinion that this is a great alternative for the rest of us who dabble in image editing and cannot justify the price of Adobe's product.  Previous Review of Paintshop Pro X6 Let me start off by saying that I am not a professional publisher nor do I create magazine ads for a living.  I am a programmer who often has the need to creative professional looking graphics for internal webpages and the like.  And, like most folks, I really would like to use Photoshop, but I can never justify the cost of a license to myself (or my employer).  Why can't there be a quality product for the rest of us that doesn't cost and arm and a leg?  And the answer is Corel Paintshop.  When I first installed the software, I wasn't expecting much - but after using it on several occasions, I can say that it is intuitive, easy to work with, and produces the same type of effects and functionality that I would use in Photoshop at 1/6 of the price.  Oh, I am sure that Photoshop can do more than this, but for your average person, I think that Paintshop is perfect.  I have nothing bad to say about this software and think it is a great value compared to Adobe Phtoshop.",1008
9089.0,582,5.0,"One huge issue with Adobe products (which I equate to Adobe shooting themselves in the foot), is their change from perpetual licenses to a subscription-only licensing model. This basically means that you can end up paying thousands of dollars in the long run to Adobe, only to have usage rights to your software suddenly removed when you stop paying the monthly fee.  Thankfully, Corel has not gone that horrible route yet. So if you're an experienced Adobe Illustrator user, and hate Adobe's new licensing mode, you might want to consider corel.  Basically you can set some interface elements to match that of Adobe Illustrator. This makes it easy to use when coming from Adobe's side to Corel. Now even though this might make it easy for people to switch over, it doesn't mean that it looks EXACTLY like Illustrator. The high level layout looks similar, but the design and certain deeper elements are obviously different. For example, one major issue I have is with the keyboard shortcuts. Illustrator keyboard shortcuts mean other things in CorelDRAW.  In any case, after using the software for a few days I got used to the interface and found it very intuitive to use.  Overall, I think this is a great high end vector graphic software, and an excellent alternative to Illustrator (actually a better one, when you consider the horrible Adobe DRM).",888
8984.0,576,5.0,"I absolutely enjoyed using Sony Movie Studio 13 suite.

Sony Movie Studio 13 Suite is aimed for the audience who is more into social media (it's very easy to share completed videos directly to FB!)  If you don't need some less used pro level tools of Premiere Pro (and After Effects), and want to OWN the software instead of leasing it at approximately $50 / month, then Sony Movie Studio is definitely worth a consideration.  The included Sony Sound Forge Audio Studio 10 is an added bonus for editing, mixing and blending audio tracks. The vocal eraser allows karaoke tunes to be created from more traditional audio sources.

997.0,71,4.0,"I've used them all... McAfee, Norton, Trend Micro and Zone Alarm.  McAfee and Norton are expensive (now zone alarm is too), with little to no real customer support.  They all (except Trend Micro which has excellent customer support) charge a fee for calling support.  A Caveat with ZA, If YOU don't read the begining tutorial, then when your PC doesn't connect to the internet don't blame ZA!!!  There's a brief 3 minute tutorial that lets ZA know your level of computer experteise.  If you're a novice, ZA will self-configure the firewall.  If you're an expert, you get to control program access yourself.  Zone Alarm's Firewall is the best on the market.  It is the only firewall to give you an alert WITH a recommended suggestion on what to do based upon it's knowledge of the program thats trying to access the internet, or trying to receive information from the internet for the first time.  ZA's firewall is also PC specific.  It will alert you if a program is acting suspiciously on your PC and lets you know what to do.  Sometimes it doesn't have a suggestion, so here's where some common sense comes in, as well as some PC experteise.  If you're installing a program, or uninstalling, or running a program, and ZA pops up, then it probably is something you want to allow, or it will block what you're trying to do.  McAfee is effective but slow, Norton doesn't pick up everything and sometimes can't delete things and you have to do it manually, Trend Micro also has failed in automatic deletion and has many 'manual' removal messages for various viruses and trojans (and we're paying for what?).  Zone Labs is one of the few that have caught, and automatically deleted most test viruses and trojans (and real) that I've run on my PC.  It wins out over the other 3 in that it gives the user super control over the PC.  You get automatic deletion and/or quarantene  You get to say what program gets access, which program does not, and how often.  You can approve every attempt to access the internet by a program, or every time something from the internet tries to access your PC.  So, its great for the intermediate and the expert user alike.  Cons:  Its spyware isn't up to par with any other program.  Ad-aware, spybot search and destroy and pest patrol are far supeior.  It takes a little PC adeptness to correctly use this program.  If you block the wrong program, or deny the wrond network connection, you'll be blocked from accessing the internet, or sharing files or something you don't want.  Hence the many people who complain about it.  This is by far the best program on the market for your money, but you need to be adept and familir with networking, windows, ports that programs use to access the net, what every program is and why it is accessing the net, ETC.  If you don't know, then get a different program.  McAfee and Norton are effective but you don't get the control and ease of use.  Trend Micro is the easiest of all, but you don't get firewall controll over outbound connections.  So, this is not a novice program, and should be used by the more experienced.  Overall, the speed and firewall coupled with an antivirus program that actually works led me to keep ZoneLabs my internet security suite for over 2 years now.  (though I do run McAfee, AVG, Norton, and trend on other pc's), on my personal PC that I use the most, I trust ZA for the best security.  PC Geek tested and approved!  A.  They only get 4 stars because they charge you for customer support (BOO 70 dollars isn't enough for the program AND support?).

4199.0,279,5.0,"Just like Windows 7 Ultimate for my dual-booting Intel Macs, Windows 7 Professional on my former Vista laptop makes for a great Internet access terminal from the comfort of our futon. It also makes for a great secondary Windows 7 laptop for trips to my Aunt Wilda and Uncle Eay's house. When we are there it sits in their living room with an external Microsoft mouse and it is perfect for that too.  You see, I insist on optimum software for my computers, so that they can do everything I need. Windows Vista Home Premium on that laptop just was not providing it. It wasn't as terrible as some people say it is, because I spent more money for better hardware. But there were times when I wanted to take it back-and one time I almost did. They didn't accept it though, and that was most fortunate as it turned out.  And yes, I found out that Windows Vista Home Premium couldn't be upgraded in place to Windows 7 Professional. But unlike some people, I had seen that, for me at least, Windows 7 was worth the hassle, and sure enough it has been.  I use Office 2007 on the Professional laptop as well as the Ultimate MacBook Pro, and it has pleased me to all get out. I however don't have any more resources for legal Office 2007, so the iMac will get 2010 Professional through that student offer once I get enough money. Windows 7 and Office 2007, especially on the Professional laptop, seems to be plenty sufficient though-Daddy is the resident March Madness Bracketologist at his workplace and Windows 7 Professional amd Office 2007 Professional's cooperation has really benefited him in that.  I love being able to Remote Desktop the Windows 7 laptop from the iMac or MacBook Pro, although I might have to try Windows Live Mesh from Windows Live Essentials to see if it can remote desktop in Aero like on the commercials.  I like Windows 7 Professional on the former Windows 7 laptop just as much as I do Windows 7 Ultimate on the Intel Macs, considering their respective purposes. Their roles are different, but each fulfills it's role perfectly, and Windows 7 Professional facilitates that in a way Windows 7 Home Premium just wouldn't.  Update 1-17-2013: I will be updating all of the reviews for all of the Windows 7 installers I have on tap to reflect a certain difference betweem me and the average reviewer:  I to date have done all of my installs (whether of Ultimate Full Purchase Product, Ultimate Upgrade, Professional Upgrade through the Windows 7 Student Offer, Home Premium Upgrade, or Home Premium Upgrade Family Pack) through the clean install method and it never fails to grab all of the updates, update to SP1, and then grab the missing post-SP1 updates.  I therefore believe that the people who can't fully update Windows didn't do the clean install method, and while I don't blame them, I don't have the time personally for a system that behaves strangely because Windows Vista was trying to be transmuted into Windows 7, when it's hard enough for one service pack of Windows 7 to be successfully transmuted into another.  I hope that if you are blaming Windows 7 for your issues when upgrading from Vista, that this advice can be of use.  Update 2-3-2014:  Windows 7 is a good OS for those people who don't want a Mac but don't want Windows 8 either. It does do Classic appearance differently from Windows Vista and earlier, instead using the square buttons even in Classic appearance, but that's OK, because I dreamed of an OS with this functionality in the taskbar since Windows 95. And the redesigned taskbar is even in Windows 7 Home Premium. Sure you may lose some of the features in the Ultimate Edition, but you get everything you absolutely have to have-although Windows 7 Anytime Upgrade is no longer available to Windows 7 users, so buying the right edition of Windows 7 is extra-crucial. If you buy Windows 7 Home Premium and later find out you need XP Mode, you're going to have to sell your copy of Home Premium (assuming you're using the retail copy) and replace it with a retail copy of Ultimate or Professional.  Windows XP may have been great in 2001, but Windows 7 is as close to XP as you can make Vista-and has proven worthwhile ever since 2009.  For further proof, look at how Microsoft released Internet Explorer 10 and 11 for Windows 7, they sure didn't have to do that. But they realized Windows 7 was still popular (so popular I have 7 copies of it, including a Family Pack of Home Premium) and so they released as many of their updated components as they could for Windows 7 without totally making Windows 8/8.1 a non-issue.  End Update 2-3-2014  Update 2-21-2014:  The laptop I feared was dead just needed someone to show it was still important and cared for. Once done, it's now back working and let me tell you, I don't care that the laptop I'm currently running this copy of Windows 7 Professional on is 32-bit only and is a Pentium Dual-Core version of a Core Duo with 2GB of memory. I will take it and leave Windows 8 regular edition craptops for those who feel like playing with their digital lives.  Me? I want something that no matter how old, was highly regarded upon release, and not a zoo's worth of headaches from the underpinnings to the bifurcated UI and everything in the middle.  Windows 7 Professional may not have all the features it did when I initially penned this review, but the inexcusable waste of Windows 7 profits to release the Vista 2.0 that is 8 saddens me. It's not quality. And when the interior of the OS is rotten, there's only so much painting the outside edifice of the OS can do.  As a Windows 7 user in the post-Sinofsky era, I can attest to getting the supposedly Windows 8 exclusive of .NET Framework 4.5 in 4.5 SP1 implementation on Windows 7, thus showing that while Windows 8 may have more powerful hardware, you know the fusion of mobile and desktop means more apps running simultaneously and that means systems that had plenty of RAM for a compelling desktop experience in Windows 7 (witness this laptop) suddenly are getting out of memory errors with Windows 8-it's like trying to install Vista Home Basic (not Home Premium, because Home Premium has Aero which Windows 8 of any edition lacks because Microsoft felt it was ""obsolete"" when in reality I still measure a Windows XP or later computer's worth by ""Is it able to display Aero and do so with full 7 drivers?""  This laptop I am posting today's update on may not be much, but I wouldn't take the most popular HP laptop with 8 on Amazon for it, no matter how positive the reviews may be.  End Update 2-21-2014.  Update 2-27-2014:  I configured a spare 1TB hard drive in a $400 Gateway PC that had received a clean install of Windows 7 Home Premium from the Family Pack to be a remote network backup destination for my Windows 7 PCs (since the Time Capsule was designed primarily for Macs, which it's cross-platform support is not really there, at least as of the revision that was most compatible with my main Mac, even though it's 2008 vintage) and Windows 7 Professional is busy backing up along with Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade and full install on the other two main PCs, and I am surprised at how easy it was.  A similar update will be posted under Windows 7 Ultimate Full Install and Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade.  End Update 2-27-2014  Update 9-16-2013 (Critical Windows 9 Status Update):  Well, consider what I uncovered about the supposedly awesome Windows 9, that's supposed to ""replace"" 7:  I also heard that Windows 9 may look like Windows 7, but this mini-start menu (based on a Microsoft press photo) has Live Tiles where links to local computer items once stood in 7. Plus Aero is still out for lunch (defenders say skeumorphism is dead, I say long live skeumorphism!), and Microsoft ties your activation to the Windows Store, so that means that they have a much more swift and sure means of sending your computer into reduced functionality mode even if you have a truly legal key!  I want my computer being rendered illegal for a good reason (at least not for something trivial like Windows 9 allows for), not because I didn't buy enough apps from the Windows Store in a given day, week, month, or year. How are you supposed to use the Metro-limited Windows 9 when not using Metro apps early and often could be grounds for your computer to be rendered illegal according to Microsoft? In effect, they've made Metro mandatory and inaccessible, rather than optional (from the ability to legally use Windows point of view, not from the it's in your face while you're using it point of view) and far too readily accessible?  I'd rather have a minor bug, as critical as the bug in question may be to the use of the computer, in the form of bad UI, than a horrible show-stopping bug that makes Windows 8's UI crimes (awful as they might have been) seem minor!  I love that they're bringing back the Start button, but what they really needed to do was scrap the Windows Store and modern apps. Not make your computer depend on them but be unable to use them because it's a desktop (known as Win32) SKU. I'm sticking with Windows 7 and as soon as it's toast no more Internet for me. I would suggest you do the same.  End Update 9-16-2014 (Critical Windows 9 Status Update)",435

7358.0,489,5.0,"I've been using this for the last 2 weeks and am really enjoying it.  It really gives you an amazing value and loads of the newest features and abilities.  If you don't want to spend over $350 for Sony Vegas Pro or over $700 for Adobe Premier Pro, then this Corel VideoStudio Pro is one of your best choices.  It has more features that any other sub-$100 video software program out there.  Compared to Adobe Premiere Elements 10 (Adobe's comparably priced video software), this software is just as easy to use but offers you many more options - like all the DSLR photo and videos features, the ability to work with huge video resolutions up to 4096 x 2160 pixels, ability to process the newest AVCHD 2.0 and AVCHD 3D video formats, Alpha Channels, slow-motion, and (most impressively) out of the box Blu-Ray video and disc rendering.  Adobe and Sony both require you to purchase another software program to render videos for Blu-ray discs.  To make this software even better, I haven't had it freeze up on my yet - which Premiere Elements would do too often for my liking - and the rendering process is faster.  Usually when companies release sub-$100 video software they give you dumbed-down versions of their pricier full-blown software... such as Adobe and Sony.  You lose features and get a product that leaves much to be desired.  Corel however has done it differently with VideoStudio Pro X6.

100.0,7,5.0,"As of December 2009 there are definitely ways to copy the DVDs to a hard drive so that the DVDs are not required to use the program.  If you install the software and use the update option in Preferences to install the latest update then you get an option to specify where the DVD data is stored, and you just need to copy the contents of the disk1-6 folders from each disk to that location. Note that this copy process is rather slow (if you have more than one DVD drive you can do more than one copy at the same time) and the data are stored in inividual image files for each page so it has to copy around 34,000 files per disk. Each file copy seems to cause the DVD drive to seek back and forth across the disk once, which means 34,000 seeks per disk which slows the process significantly (to over an hour per disk) and also might result in a significant amount of wear and tear on the DVD drive (this is speculation).  Note that you'll need 50GB of available disk space if you choose to install all the data to disk!  The developers are actively updating the program and the latest Mac version has a ""copy everything to disk"" feature which does the work for you, and the Windows version should have this same function enabled literally any day now. The web site to follow for the latest info is COMPLETENATGEO.  This version of the Complete National Geographic is *much* improved over the one from several years ago. The viewing application is a much nicer application, it scales the images to the size of the application window nicely, and the full two-page spread images are quite readable on a 24"" 1920x1200 monitor.

I had to hunt and peck for awhile as I was new to it's layout.  But, overall after you see the breakdown, etc. it is not too hard to navigate.  It does have some powerful abilities, but in my opinion not as powerful as photoshop.  Although, it does allow layers to be built and merged which is similar to photoshop.  I did not see a quick way to control each layers transparency etc. as I am accustomed to in Photoshop.  I originally opened the program with a photo to edit and simply wanted to flip it horizontally.  I looked for a long time and only found a way to rotate it. Which is not the same at all.  While continuing to feel my way around in the program, I ended up importing another pic and then discovered that via layers, you could flip the pic. It will take a bit more exploring and learning the program's abilities to get the entire ease of it's use - but overall it does seem to be a strong and solid editing program for it's price range.",1151

Full virus scans could only happen when I didn't need to do anything else with the machines as they become unusably slow.  Thus, I've been pleasantly surprised at how smoothly and quietly Norton for Mac takes care of things. It doesn't bog things down as far as we can tell. The installation was easy, and the application appears to run smoothly and stay in the background with just the occasional notification / question pop-up to respond to.  Even the thorough, file-by-file virus scan zips through smoothly and essentially in the background.  Most importantly, we've not had any virus-related issues while this software has been deployed.

I personally found it to be an excellent basic starter kit for legal business forms. If you have a larger company with an attorney you wouldn't need it, but if you are a small business just starting out it's really helpful. It has a lot of good forms and information. Even if you don't get updates you can still use the forms as a starter ground for research or to find what else you need to do. I would recommend it to anyone just starting out in the business world.  All side businesses should be set up correctly, and the forms and contracts in this software should help newbies get started. In todays world, it is as easy to create a legal business entity by just logging on to LegalZoom, or other online legal help websites.  That is just the start.  Everyone in business should learn at least a little of small business law, especially if they decide to take advantage of the convenience of sites like LegalZoom.  There is a PDF version of the following books which can help with this knowledge: - Legal Guide for Starting & Running a Small Business - The Manager's Legal Handbook - How to Write a Business Plan - Contracts: The Essential Business Desk Reference - Deduct It! Lower Your Small Business Taxes  There is a good variety included in the list of business forms included in this product, and the software is easy to install and use.  There is also a guide for getting extra help along the way.  If you are looking for something to get started with examples of forms and legal terminology in your documents, then this is probably going to work well for you.

3078.0,171,4.0,"Bento was released by the makers of FileMaker Pro with a very specific purpose. Interestingly, Bento was the name given to a layer in Apple's visionary OpenDoc architecture launched with System 7.5 in the mid 1990s.  Bento is a personal (as opposed to ""enterprise"" or networked) database that's meant to be as easy to use as the Mac itself. It has a carefully-identified set of features. These run parallel to those of iWork's Pages and Numbers. It could have been called i(Data)Base to aim at a comparable niche in the market. Bento complements Pages and Numbers nicely. The criticisms that some users (and reviewers) leveled at Bento, that it lacked, for example, scripting, Automator and network support, miss the point. It was never intended for those sorts of uses - or those types of users; look at FileMaker Pro for such extended power.  Bento was specifically designed and released without such features in order to concentrate on the less-experienced consumer and SOHO user. Some missing areas of functionality might be useful to the non-specialist user. On the whole, though, the balance between price and feature set, not to mention features, means that Bento can be safely recommended.  Bento is designed to accomplish everyday tasks using a pleasing and straightforward template-based interface The very fact that it is simple, has only one window, and just the right number and design of a few uncluttered menus adds to its accessibility and effectiveness as a flexible and powerful tool.  It only takes a quick glance at the lively, comprehensive and very well supported and moderated Bento forum to see how easy it is to achieve sophisticated date calculations and many-to-many implementation; Bento's apparent simplicity can be deceptive. Bento Users is another useful site. The documentation that comes with the product is excellent.  Everyday FileMaker has compiled a list of some of the more likely projects that Bento can handle. These include:  * what FileMaker, Inc. calls ""virtually unlimited"" contact details * coordinating events, parties, and fundraisers * tracking projects, assignments, and deadlines * prioritizing tasks; Bento has been used successfully in a Getting Things Done task management context * inventories, donations, and items for sale * track hours worked, payments due, invoicing * rate service providers and sellers * libraries for music, movies, and media * store files and photos related to projects and events  and, rather cryptically, since this ought to be part of any good data model:  * connect related information together to see more details.  There are ample standalone products to achieve many of these tasks - Project Managers like OmniPlan and task management - the same company's OmniFocus. Bruji's outstanding BookPedia and CDPedia. There are dedicated time management and billing/invoice suites like TimeNet Pro - though none without some flaw; and iPhoto, Address Book and iCal themselves, with the last two of which Bento integrates closely.  It is what it is So the criteria for MyMac's evaluation must not be, What's missing from Bento? Rather, how well does this reasonably-priced and robust Leopard-only product do what it's been designed to do?  First and foremost, then, is a courageous - and largely successful - attempt to make database design and management accessible to those who are not specialists or experts in such software, but who still have demanding needs such as some of those just mentioned.  Bento's main window consists of three panes:  The leftmost pane is the Source List of all your data Libraries. Libraries are Bento's top organizational level - like iPhoto 7's ""Events."" One Bento Library is for one set of data or project. Under these in the Source List are Bento's Collections; these are like iTunes' Playlists - subsets of the data in the Libraries. Then Smart Collections behave just as you would expect: they're Views updated in real time and as your filter criteria - or the records that matches them - change. You might, for example, want to create a Smart Collection of all unpaid invoices - as they get paid, they disappear; or of all unsold artifacts in a craft store - as they are sold, they disappear.  The records area is in the middle and is the largest pane. Data can be presented as a form (an individual record) or table of as many records as will fit into the space. You can have more than one form for any Library (each may display different fields - in different orders). This is emphasis on the user experience again; it drives the way you work. Each view is satisfactorily editable - columns can be dragged horizontally for display; you can chose which you will view too. The principles, of course, are analogous to those in FileMaker's ""Align"" routines and fit well with the sophisticated controls that Bento offers.  The Associated fields list for each Library is on the right. Fields are created here and dragged and dropped onto the Records area. There are only three attributes for each. There is also control over how many of these three panes will appear - you can focus on what you're doing.  This is a familiar interface; and it preserves the metaphors for data handling on which Bento rests. Similarly, searching, sorting, and summaries are all swift and intuitive. Searching can be very sophisticated and saved as a Smart Collection.  Note, though, that this means that there's no concept of separate datastores in Bento. All the data which you use Bento to maintain is managed in one place. You can still share Libraries with other users. Yet if you organize your data according to ""domains"" within your life (household, work, hobbies, friends, you may find it a disadvantage to access it all in and from one place by launching the Bento application itself as opposed to separately-located data files. On the other hand, this is very much in keeping with current Mac practice: it is the way that iCal, iPhoto, iTunes, iWeb (though not Pages or Numbers) all work. More evidence of the perceived target audience; for them it is assumed the task in hand is more important than file names, file management.  Data Types Given these intentional restrictions, the substantial variety of data types (nineteen of them) which Bento handles is impressive: basic text, numbers, dates, drop-downs, Booleans, graphics, sounds, movies, ratings, addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses and more. There's also a FileMaker-like calculation field which can, for example, concatenate text and multiple fields values as well as perform simple mathematical operations. Inevitably there will be some function missing for someone, but on the whole it's comprehensive - and very easy to use.  Templates For all its transparency, Bento is not a glorified Wizard. Fields can be controlled - use drag and drop. Fields are rearranged and resized with the mouse - usual Mac style. Some positioning and alignment of text is possible using a toolbar - though probably less than most people will come to want: five text sizes, no choice of fonts. One of the biggest hurdles that the marketing of Bento has to overcome is to make it plain that these are flexible means to an end - although the (new) user's first contact with the program will be the 20 templates that come with the software. These templates are shells; they are not one and the same as the data which they are used to present. If the designers of Bento have understood just what it is that a majority of users want in terms of the payoff between interface and ease of use as opposed to in depth functionality, then they have surely got a winner on their hands. The number of downloads (a quarter of a million) in the first few months since Bento became available suggests that is the case.  Address Book and iCal integration By default Bento has Libraries for contacts, events, and tasks. These are the same as those in Leopard's Address Book and iCal; they are not synched. Although these Libraries can be removed - ""Disconnected"" - from Bento in its ""Home"" menu, to do so is to lose access to those applications' data. What's more, to edit in Bento - or worse delete - data that's derived from Address Book and iCal is to lose it directly from those same applications actually outside the Bento environment. Integration is tight: you could drag and drop a set of contacts from the Address Book Library right into Bento's Source list to create a Collection. This ""disconnection"" could usefully be supplemented by a preference letting you work from a duplicate and/or advising you that you could conceivably lose permanently (unless backed up) data of which you might have thought you were only working on a copy.  Import-Export Bento supports only CSV (Comma Separated Value) for import and export of data, although there are ways aplenty to convert that after or before the fact. So that's a limitation only inasmuch as you may need another utility and two steps. The importer is drag-and-drop then Wizard-based and worked very well in testing. The Wizard asks which values from the file to be imported should correspond with which fields in Bento.  Relations The way that Bento handles relations - the fields in other tables whose data you need to appear in the current one - is one of the program's main limitations: it's not a conventional relational database. But, again, it's an approach designed to give the greatest likely desired power with the simplest steps.  In your ""local"" Library you create a field of type ""Related Records List""; then you indicate from which Library you want to use data. Dropping that field on your form displays a small empty table corresponding to the ""remote"" Library. You click the ""Add related records from a list"" icon at the bottom of the inset table to see actual data. Bento displays the corresponding list of records from the associated library. Changing records in the one changes them in the other. Deleting a record in the ""local"" Library only deletes it only from the Related Records List (the ""local"" dataset) and not from the associated Library. This more closely follows the practice of removing a record from a Smart Folder, Collection or Playlist. It's a way of preventing mistakes - although not entirely logical, until you're used to it. It's also another example of ease of use; accessibility takes precedence. Note, too though, that Smart Collections cannot include data from related tables. That may be a significant restriction for some.  What is likely to be a real drawback, though, is the fact that by ""Related Records"" Bento means essentially a ""Portal"" to all the records in the ""remote"" Library. There is no concept of a ""Join"" using Primary and Foreign Keys. This means that you cannot be selective in the way you relate and view such records.  Conclusions Bento is a package. A compromise. MyMac's advice is that - after reading this review - you match what it can do against your needs. Almost certainly you may have requirements which Bento seems unable to meet. But look closely. Sure, its interface is user-friendly - and more important, perhaps, Bento itself is easy to use. But this doesn't mean it's in any way crippled and ""less than"" comparable databases of this level of complexity - relational features aside.  It's much closer to Pages, Numbers, iPhoto, iTunes in feel and scope than it is to FileMaker. But prolonged use for this review has revealed that Bento can easily be made to do more than might be apparent even from glancing familiarity with the delightful sophistication of the interface.  Given some of the things that Bento can do, there's a remarkably high ratio between effort and result. Whether or not it's for you will depend firstly on whether you have Leopard. Then on your data handling requirements: total size of data set, complexity of relations and perhaps the way (or whether) you use iCal and Address Book. Then you should decide whether one of the absent features (scripting, full control over template fonts, a missing calculation, say) rules it out.  For many users the extremely pleasing appearance of Bento will be a winner. How nice to be able to work in a fully Mac-like environment using an inventory of - car parts.  A balance has been struck: users with complex, evolving and intricately relational databases may still be best with FileMaker Pro. Those for whom the lure of an elegant user interface is important and/or who want a direct equivalent of Numbers, Pages and iPhoto/iTunes and/or seamless integration with iCal and Address Book should look seriously at Bento. Download the trial, use it carefully and draw on the many sources of online help, remember its very reasonable price, decide whether you'll be able to make Bento do a variety of things for you larger than the dedicated software mentioned at the beginning of this review can do - and see!  Pros: the interface - it's good-looking, simple and easy to use; many data types supported; integration with Address Book and iCal; templates work with many types of file; works with iPhone and .Mac  Cons: the interface - the changes you can make to its appearance are somewhat limited; poor relational capabilities; mass updates to records not supported  MyMac.com Rating: 4 out of 5 Originally published at : [...]",429

3149.0,183,3.0,"I just updated to Vista from Windows XP.  I find XP easier to navigate, but perhaps it`s because I`ve had years of experience with XP and have only recently been introduced to Vista.  I am sure I will get more comfortable with Vista in time.  Vista does run very smoothly and I love the desktop sidebar, to which we can add numerous little gadgets, like a clock, calendar, weather reports.  So handy.  I wonder why they didn't think of that earlier.  I had been desperately searching for such features for my XP before running into it on Vista.  My only complaint about it is the compatibility issues I'm having with a few things.  I am sure that eventually, this will cease to be a problem.  I cannot install my Palm desktop to sync my Palm T/X.  I cannot use my American Greetings subscription to print out cards.  I cannot install the XACTI camcorder software.  It's frustrating, because it seems like everything can run on XP.  Not everyone wants or needs to use parental controls, but I happen to like them.

Overall, Windows Vista is easy to use and has some terrific new features, like parental controls and the sidebar, but some compatibility issues still need to be worked out.  The Movie Maker has potential; but I just can't use it easily, because it doesn't support mp4 files.  I recommend waiting, if you are buying Vista as an upgrade.

6751.0,445,3.0,"I have been using Pinnacle Studio since version 9. It has been the easiest to use, most intuitive video editing software out there. Earlier versions had problems with the program crashing, and unless the video was constantly saved, any work was lost when it crashed. In 2005 Pinnacle was sold to Avid, which is the Rolls Royce of digital video editing. Most multi-million dollar feature films use Avid editing technology, just look at the credits. Avid cleaned up the code behind the scenes, making the program usable! It stopped crashing, and even if it did, somehow, Studio managed to save all of your work so once the computer was rebooted you could get back to work right where you left off. Under Avid, video rendering speed improved, the user interface improved without any drastic changes, and Studio became a reliable program. Avid did a nice job with Studio, and kept the system requirements fairly minimal. Up until version 15 I was able to use a Pentium 4 2.80GHz Hyperthreading processor running Windows 7 with decent results.  In July 2012 Pinnacle was sold to Corel, and they have made a few changes to the Studio program. The saddest change for me is that I am no longer able to use my Pentium 4 2.80 GHz computer using this program anymore, the system requirements are just too great that program barely runs on this system. I have tested Studio on a laptop with an i5 processor and it works better, but I expected even faster performance than I got. The rendering with an i5 processor is pitifully slow.  I'm afraid you might need a supercomputer to get fast rendering speed with Studio 16 Ultimate!  Corel also drastically changed the user interface as well. The once easy to use intuitive interface is gone, replaced by their own confusing library, timeline, effects control and disc interfaces. Sadly, the learning curve is great if you have used Studio products in the past as you enter unfamiliar territory with Corel's version of Pinnacle Studio Ultimate. To Corel's benefit they do include an instructional DVD entitled ""Getting Started With The New Pinnacle Studio"", and there is a step by step Quick Start Guide, but the beauty of the old interface was that you could just sit down and use it, it was that intuitive.  As with all Studio Ultimate Editions you get a great collection of effects, transitions and plug ins. Version 16 includes Red Giant Magic Bullet: Looks, Mojo, Cosmo, Knoll Light Factory, Warp, Shine and Particular as well as a huge library of transitions, filters and effects, all of which take a long time to render.  It also takes about 6 GB of Hard Drive space and about an hour's time for a full installation. Studio 16 even includes a green screen for compositing and special effects. You can even make 3D videos in this version. Truly the amount of stuff you get for the money is impressive. Studio also includes 50GB of free storage on Box to share and store your videos in the cloud. Using Box you can go back and forth with your videos on the iPad if you have Studio for iPad.  As a previous Pinnacle Studio user I am somewhat disappointed with Studio 16. It seems like you really need a beefed up system to get anything done, you need to learn a new interface with new controls, what they do, where everything is, and it feels like you are starting from scratch. Maybe I just feel a bit overwhelmed over the differences between versions. After watching the tutorial DVD I know that I need to become more familiar with this version, and maybe I will like it better.  I just wanted to warn previous Studio users that Pinnacle Studio 16 is much different than the Studio you were used to.",49

Installation - Installation was very easy. If you have conflicting software, i.e. another Roxio program that has similar features, such as a burner, then it will ask you if it's OK to uninstall it. And the only way to install it is if you let it uninstall the previous software. Unfortunately, it does not tell you what the conflicting software is so this is only going on assumption. It's really just clicking on OK and next and the software is installed. Keeping in mind that before you can really use the software, you need to restart your computer.  Usage - Burning CDs/DVDs is easy with this. When you put a disc in, it is instantly recognized by the software and you are able to burn it from the quick launch if you would like. I have also put two pictures side by side and that was easy to do once you figure it out. I didn't find anything in the picture editing software that allows a cutout so you can take an object and make the background transparent so it is a little bit lacking if you're really looking for a comprehensive picture editing tool. The video editor is also easy to use. You can locate videos and pictures you want to put in there. You're even able to flip videos clockwise/counter-clockwise, an especially useful feature if you are like me and use the iPhone for some video capture and when it gets put on the computer, it's not rotated properly. Overall, the features are pretty straightforward. It isn't going to be extremely advanced but for a simple novice or if you're just needing this for simple adjustments, it works great.  Performance - This is where I had to take stars off for this. It seems to have slowed my computer down a bit so starting up takes a little bit longer. Another issue I have noticed is that when I was exporting my video project, it froze the program a while before it would allow you to export it. My other gripe is that right after installing it, my computer suddenly crashed for no reason. This only happened once but I have to blame this software since I have never seen my computer do that before. It could just be that you need an extremely new computer to run this software but if that's the case, Roxio is a little bit short-sighted as not everyone can upgrade their computer every 2 years or so.  Overall, it does come with a lot of features. All of the things you can do with this program is a bit intermediate level and not really for an advanced user who is relying on this for state of the art photo editing or movie making. It also seem to have a bit of performance issues so hopefully Roxio fixes this in future products.",1033

5873.0,393,3.0,"After tracking my personal income/expenses on spreadsheets, I decided to try Quicken.  Set up is easy, but Quicken really, really wants to interface with your bank accounts & makes it a little difficult to set up an account not using an interface.  My banks charge anywhere from $5 - $10/mo to download to Quicken, Quickbooks or Money.  The only answer I could get from my banks was that Intuit charges the banks for downloading (I do not whether this is true or not, but the banks would not budge on waiving the monthly fee unless I had an exorbitant amount of money in my account).  I can download to an excel type file from my bank, but can't figure out how to import that into Quicken.  I still have to play with this and report findings in the future.  I was able to set up my accounts & manually input my information.  Once this is done & assuming that I can keep up with the manual data input, the Quicken software should do a good job of helping me track my accounts.  It seems that it can be as basic or fancy as I want.  I will update once I have more data to manipulate in the software.  So far, so good.  However, I downgraded my star rating because of the charges for downloading my bank transactions and the fact that Quicken doesn't readily explain how to import an excel file into their software.",84
11030.0,706,4.0,"I've used PaintShop for years. This is a speedy addition to the long line of predecessors. It's extremely quick, which really is a nice change (recent models have been faster, but I'm still flinching from the PaintShop versions of yore that made you feel like you were watching paint dry, waiting for them to load.)  This version, though, does have more than a bit of a learning curve, even for people who have used the product before. It's definitely high end for getting results from  your photo manipulation. I haven't spent as much time on this as I should, but because I'm familiar with the company's software, it's not completely unfamiliar.  I also think the price is decent for the level of sophistication. This is a very nice set up.

990.0,70,1.0,"I've read all of the glowing reviews of Toast Titanium 7 - ""makes music DVDs, multi-DVD spanning backups, cures cancer, raises the dead, etc.""  And having used previous versions of Toast, I thought I'd spring for the upgrade. Big mistake.  Although I've been using computers for 20 years now (mostly Macs), I've had nothing but problems with this new version of Toast. I haven't had a single successful burn yet, on any kind of media, recording any kind of format.  I thought updating to the latest version might be helpful, but Roxio won't let you download it unless you're a registered user on their website.  Understandable - but I AM a registered user, and their system wouldn't recognize me. So I tried to open a new account, and it wouldn't let me. Okay, I clicked their ""forgot my password"" button, and they say they'll send me a link via email. I've played that little game for about 3 days now, and never a message/link from Roxio.  Trying to solve my tech problems online hasn't helped; Toast keeps giving me error codes which aren't defined anywhere on Roxio's help pages.  Maybe, some bright and glorious day, I'll actually get the program to work and it will merit more than 1 star. But my old version (5.2.3) worked fine, and I dropped a lot of money for a few glittery features...and instead lost all the previous functionality and raised my blood pressure in the bargain. Shame on you, Roxio!  UPDATE:  Okay, three hair-pulling days later I STILL haven't had a successful burn. It's amazing what new ""features"" Roxio has added this time around. For instance, Toast will tell you that you have more than enough room on your disk for the burn, then grind away for an hour or so, then pop up a message saying ""Ooh, sorry, there's not enough space after all.""  Or it's fun to ask it to burn a VCD - at which point it suddenly can't find my disc burner anymore (funny, it was there a moment ago).  Want to compress a long movie the way you can in Popcorn? Well, there's probably a way - but [CENSORED] if I can find it by steering through Toast's incredibly unintuitive interface.  And, oh yes, Roxio's website still won't admit that I'm a customer. If you log on with a new email address and password (as a new user), you'll be able to download the latest update. And you'd better do it during that session, because next time you try to log on, Roxio will have no recollection of your sign-in information (well nearly none - they recognize your email address, but deny your password so you CAN'T log in. Ask them to send you a password reminder, and nothing ever ever ever comes.)  I've used Toast for years, and thought it was a great program. I'm NOT an idiot - honest. But Toast Titanium 7 has so far been a complete and frustrating waste of my money. ZERO STARS!!!!!!!!!!!  (Roxio - I loathe you!)  UPDATE #2 - After a month of trying, I've finally been able to burn a single disk! Wow! Of course, I could have done this with iDVD, any earlier version of Toast, or simply the Mac's OS...but where would the challenge (or expense) be in that? Currently I'm trying to make one of the much-touted ""Music DVD"" disks - but for some reason, even though all of my music files are ALREADY compressed to the MP3 specs that Roxio wants, it's re-encoding every freakin' song. On a G4 Mac with dual processors, it seems like it will take about 8 hours to create a single disk. And really, all Toast is doing is adding a menu structure to an MP3 disk that should have taken about 10 minutes to burn. To quote Monty Python: ""RUN AWAY!! RUN AWAY!!""",437
9097.0,582,5.0,"My buddies and I are trying to start a Youtube channel with an accompanying website and that means we need many things, original graphic art being one of them.  My crew and I primarily operate MacBooks so our options for software are limited.  With the opportunity to try out Corel Graphic Suite X7 I handed the trials over to our artist/token PC user since X7 operates on Windows only and, so far, we've been impressed with his work while he's been intrigued over the ease of use and complete control over what he does.  The first thing we noticed is that the software doesn't require much in terms of system requirements so our friend with a relatively older PC was able install and utilize it with no issues.  It ran smoothly and was amplified by the fact that it's user-interface is very intuitive (has features where an artist would want them to be rather than require a treasure hunt to find) and user-friendly.  This saves a lot of time on production since no one likes to navigate through endless menus to find one simple feature.  After a week of playing around with the features our artists sent in his first samples and the results are nice.  Granted we're doing this for a youtube page and website, which the software seems grossly overqualified for, but it allowed our guy to crank out images and samples like none other and we're very impressed with the output.  However, one of the issues we ran into were that not all of us can read Corel images without sufficient patches, which weren't a problem but goes to show that one must be ready for PC-Mac interfacing if you're running any kind of business/project with a diverse collection of computers.  All in all, I can't say if X7 is better than Adobe or Photoshop, which are used by most professionals I know in the industry, but we're happy with it on our lower end of the spectrum as we inch our way upward.  A pricey, but worthy purchase for anyone that wants to get started and avoid the stigma that is MS Paint.",1414

9439.0,601,5.0,"As a professional photographer I have a reputation for having a creative eye. Likewise as a graphic artist I can communicate compelling thoughts and concepts through visual media relatively effortlessly. But I know my limits - I am not a sketch artist nor a painter. Put a brush in my hand and never in a million years will I come up with the Mona Lisa. My sketching skills tend toward mechanical drawing ... linking a series of boxes and circles and lines which I do daily when I am trying to conceptualize a project. So imagine my surprise when I opened this software app called SketchBook and without reading a words of instructions the first thing I did is drew a cat's face, with a very coy Disney cartoon look on her face. I'm excited about the possibilities that a $60 app can bring to my creative toolbox. On that basis I recommend SketchBook to anyone who already has a creative knack or a wants to develop their skills to express themselves visually. The startup learning curve is nowhere near as daunting as other apps I've previously tried but the creative possibilities seem to fairly endless.  I strongly recommend that you read V.Hutson's review of this product and watch her excellent video. It is in my opinion the definitive Amazon review of this product, coupled with an excellent video. It is helpful to get the opinion about a product like this from someone who has artistic skills, it helps people like me who are still developing their sketching abilities.  There was a little glitch in which the needed serial number was not included with the installation disk. Amazon quickly discovered the error and sent an email out with the proper serial number shortly thereafter. Not including the serial number with the DVD was probably a simple oversight and should not reflect on the merits of the software and certainly should not drag it down to 1-star for a minor inconvenience.  Bottom line: this software is cheap enough to buy and is easily worth the price. Creativity is a very personal thing and it is hard to put a finger on whether this particular app is best for you. As I often say about camera equipment, it's not the camera that creates a great photograph it is the photographer. So with this app, and some practice on your part, it might be the right tool to give you the results you want.",69

6030.0,403,5.0," Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:  Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!   Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating  Ergonomics & Usability:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating  Performance, Stability & Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating  Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating   Positives:   Many stability and performance issues from the previous X3 versions of both PaintShop Pro and VideoStudio Pro were resolved in this X4 version. It runs noticeably quicker, even on slower 5-year old laptops and small netbooks, with good stability.  PaintShop Pro X4 offers a very wide range of tools for both photo editing and graphic design, ranging from serious photography-specific tools to fun graphics manipulation.  PaintShop Pro X4 combines photo editing, photo retouching, painting, drawing, graphics design, and image management in a single package.  PaintShop Pro X4 has a great selection of photo enhancement tools, both to fix common photography issues and also more esoteric image manipulation tools.  PaintShop Pro X4 includes Web graphics tools for image mapping and slicing, and for coding image rollovers and Web button creation.  Very affordable, yet very powerful, for both photo and video editing; currently selling on Amazon at a heavily discounted pricing of less than $90.  A very useful ""Learning Center"" and video tutorials help newbies learn the software and accomplish common tasks.  The PaintShop Pro X4 user interface is divided into three tabs, ""Manage"", ""Adjust"", ""Edit"", providing a usable workflow from initial photo review to final editing, and allowing you to configure, customize, and save how you use each workspace. You can also customize each toolbar individually.  VideoStudio Pro's ""Smart Proxy"" editing mode lets you can edit high-definition video in a low-resolution mode, thereby allowing you to use a slower computer without necessarily slowing down to a sluggish crawl.  VideoStudio Pro has a new time-lapse photography feature to create time-lapse movies from a set of photos shot over a period of time.  The included proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization for use in VideoStudio Pro X4 works wonderfully to stabilize and remove the shake from hand-held videos.   Negatives:   Even though the new HDR ""Exposure Merge"" tool in PaintShop Pro X4 is a great start, the tool is not always precise at aligning objects between bracketed shots and it is especially lacking in deghosting; both problems can arise from either camera movement or movement of objects in the scene.  PaintShop Pro X4 has limited RAW file processing capabilities and compatibilities compared to Adobe Lightroom, but Corel now intends for RAW handling to be better addressed in their new AfterShot Pro software.  Despite being more uncluttered and streamlined than the previous X3 version's user interface, the ""Edit"" tab of the new PaintShop Pro X4 user interface, which serves as the main workhorse for serious image editing, is still somewhat cluttered and disorganized, with overlapping functions and ambiguous groupings of tools, and this impacts the ergonomics and usability of the software, especially for new users.  For the graphics newbie who has no previous experience using graphics software, there is a medium-to-high learning curve effort required to learn how to proficiently use the PaintShop Pro software. This software is not specifically designed for simple image manipulation by novices. If you are initially learning this software, you should start off just using the ""Adjust"" tab and not use the ""Edit"" tab; the ""Adjust"" tab is simplified and suitable to novices whereas the ""Edit"" tab is meant for power users.  As with some of Corel's other recent products, accessing the help documentation for both PaintShop Pro and VideoStudio Pro requires access to Corel's online Web site for information, instead of being able to access all help documentation locally on my computer directly from within the application.  What is in the box package of ""Corel Photo and Video Pro X4 Ultimate Bundle""?   2 PaintShop Pro software CDs (for Windows 7/Vista/XP)  1 VideoStudio Pro software CD (for Windows 7/Vista/XP)  3D glasses  Leaflet with WinZip Pro compression software download instructions and activation code.

PaintShop Pro X4 User Guide  VideoStudio Pro X4 User Guide  VideoStudio Pro X4 ""Getting Started"" Guide  This affordably-priced bundle essentially consists of two separate Corel products: PaintShop Pro X4 and VideoStudio Pro X4. In addition, the ""Ultimate"" extras that separate it from their non-Ultimate counterparts include: Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0 photographic filters, extra ""Picture Tube"" images for use in PaintShop Pro, proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization for use in VideoStudio Pro, Boris Graffiti 5.3 for text/title/graphics animation and 3D effects, and coupons for WinZip software, Blurb.com photo book, and 21 free image downloads from Fotolia's Web site. If you are really only interested in either PaintShop Pro X4 or VideoStudio Pro X4, but do not want both products, you can just purchase either product in their separate ""Ultimate"" packaging.  I have always been a fan of PaintShop Pro throughout the 1990s and I have often kept updating PSP versions after Corel acquired its original developer, JASC Software, in 2004, even though I also have been updating versions of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite starting from CorelDRAW 5. Along with recently releasing the new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-AfterShot-Pro/dp/B006WVR9GY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel AfterShot Pro</a>&nbsp;this year (after Corel acquired Bibble Labs and repackaged their ""Bibble Pro"" as ""AfterShot Pro"") and also the newly updated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CorelDRAW-Graphics-Suite-X6/dp/B007IWCQ8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X6</a>, which includes Corel's original photo-editor called ""Photo-Paint"", Corel now has three photo applications which have some overlapping functions and also unique abilities of their own. As a photo management application, AfterShot Pro is meant to complement PaintShop Pro and compete against Adobe Photoshop Lightroom. PaintShop Pro remains my favorite ""Photoshop for the non-professional-graphics masses"" application, being more feature-packed and capable like Photoshop CS than Adobe's own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-10/dp/B005MMMT6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Photoshop Elements 10</a>.  Even though my video-editing skills rank far behind my photo-editing and graphics design skills, I started using Corel's VideoStudio Pro software when it was at version ""X2"". The VideoStudio Pro X4 version that is included in this software bundle offers powerful video editing with great stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities. But as with the PaintShop Pro photo software, you need plenty of patience to progressively learn all of its features.  The Corel Photo and Video Pro X4 Ultimate Bundle's notable product features are described and rated below:   Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating:   After Corel acquired JASC Software, they have been adding new features with each release, and even though this version runs and feels slower than earlier versions of PSP, I feel that it is a fair trade-off to allow the code bloat due to the number and complexity of features to slow the software down. With this latest X4 version, I get a powerful set of photo and graphics editing tools that is more useful than Photoshop Elements 10. PaintShop Pro X4 pales in comparison to the power of the full-blown Photoshop CS, but with its significantly lower pricing and learning curve compared to Photoshop CS, it is obviously meant to compete against software like Photoshop Elements, which it handily outperforms.   This ""Ultimate"" version of PaintShop Pro X4 adds even more power and value by including the award-winning Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0 photographic filters, which includes 52 photographic filters that can be applied to images to give them special effects. Also included in this Ultimate version is a collection of ""Picture Tubes"", which are thematic collections of graphics that can be painted onto an image to add more bling to your images, frames, and borders.   To help you navigate through the plethora of PaintShop Pro tools and effects, a very useful 'Effect Browser' lets you try out the various effects, instead of accessing each effect one by one.   PaintShop Pro includes tools that are very friendly to use by newbies such as 'One Step Photo Fix', 'Smart Photo Fix', and 'One Step Noise Removal'.   The new PaintShop Pro HDR (High Dynamic Range) ""Exposure Merge"" tool is Corel's foray into HDR software, which Adobe and other graphics software vendors are also incorporating into their tools. HDR processing involves combining multiple exposures of the exact same shot (which is easier if your camera has an Automatic Exposure Bracketing (AEB) function) to create a high dynamic range photo which can display a higher tonal range than what the camera is capable of capturing in a single exposure. There are various software specifically dedicated to HDR processing. For the past four years, since version 3 in 2008, I have been using the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Photomatix-Pro-4/dp/B002CIP12U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Photomatix Pro 4</a>&nbsp;software for HDR processing. On a relative scale specifically rating its HDR functions, I would rate Photomatix 5 fuzzy stars while this PaintShop Pro X4's new HDR ""Exposure Merge"" tool only gets 3 fuzzy stars rating. Both Corel and Adobe still have a long way to catch up with the powerful and flexible offerings in Photomatix. In particular, I found the ""Exposure Merge"" tool in this version of PaintShop Pro X4 to be lacking in its ability to precisely align bracketed photos and thoroughly and flexibly remove ghosting artifacts, which is something that Photomatix does a very good job at. If you use a tripod-mounted camera to shoot bracketed photos where nothing in the scene moves the least bit, then the ""Exposure Merge"" tool consistently outputs good HDR results. But when shooting portraits or landscapes, or shooting hand-held, bracketed photos often have misaligned objects and/or moving objects in the shots. Even bracketed portrait shots of a person using a tripod can result in tiny movements by the person that require excellent alignment and deghosting by HDR software, and Photomatix currently beats PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool in this area. PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool frequently has ghosting artifacts leftover either from movement of the camera by the photographer or movement of objects in the scene. This ghosting is especially evident in scenes such as landscapes where various plants may be moving in the breeze or portraits where the subject has slightly moved in between each bracketed shot.  Photomatix also includes a plethora of other tone mapping, image stacking, and on-the-fly editing adjustments, including being able to define specific areas of photos to deghost and specific areas of photos where I can use the original image instead of the HDR output. I use these Photomatix functions a lot because I always aim for very natural-looking HDR images, instead of the surreal psychedelic HDR images that are, all too often, output by people. HDR software can be abused to create unnatural over-saturated photos that become tiresome to look at. Using Photomatix on an image of people set against a beautiful background landscape, I can tell the software to use an original un-HDR'ed exposure of a photo for the people's faces while letting the software HDR-process the rest of the landscape, and this is very useful to me because HDR-processed skin tones can sometimes look unnatural. PaintShop Pro's ""Exposure Merge"" tool cannot perform these functions that I described. So a good HDR workflow would be to HDR-process your bracketed photos first using Photomatix, and then further edit the HDR output in PaintShop Pro, perhaps performing some sharpening as the last step before saving the files.   The new PaintShop Pro ""Photo Blend"" tool lets you merge the best aspects of multiple photos into one photo by removing, swapping, or adding details to the final combined photo. This is often used for group shots when you have some people with eyes open and some with eyes closed, or to remove distracting objects from a static scene such as cars and other strangers in the background, but this can also be used for fun creative purposes as well. As with the new ""Exposure Merge"" HDR tool, this is ideally used with identically composed photos that were all shot from a tripod or a very steady hand.   The new PaintShop Pro ""Selective Focus"" tool is pretty fun to work with, letting you simulate the effect of tilt-shift lenses (e.g. Lensbaby) by selectively blurring areas. This is also somewhat similar to simulating a shallow depth of field when using a large aperture setting on a camera lens to get a blurry bokeh background surrounding your main subject of focus.   A new PaintShop Pro ""Fill Light"" filter lets your brighten shadow areas in photos and a separate ""Clarity"" filter lets you sharpen or soften subtle details in a photo. These two filters, presented together as a single tool, can be used, for example, on a portrait to brighten a dark shadowed region of the face while selectively softening the wrinkles on the person's face for portraits shot in the harsh bright glare of mid-day sun.   Although Corel hopes that users perform RAW conversion using their new AfterShot Pro software (which was formerly ""Bibble Pro"" before Corel acquired Bibble Labs), PaintShop Pro still includes its ""Camera RAW Lab"" for RAW conversion, and this X4 version adds new highlight recovery options to recover details in overexposed regions of a photo.   PaintShop Pro has built-in one-click photo sharing that lets you upload photos to either Facebook or Flickr, or send via email. Likewise, VideoStudio Pro lets you upload movies to YouTube.   I had fun using VideoStudio Pro's new time-lapse photography feature. I used a Canon Timer Remote Controller TC-80N3 to shoot a series of timer-delayed photos of the sun setting behind the mountains and another cool every-two-minutes photo series that I made last summer of a morning glory vine slowly opening up its blooms, and then I used the VideoStudio Pro X4's time-lapse photography feature to create a video from both of these photo series that look like a sped-up time-lapse movie. If both videos had been recorded as real-time videos, they would have been mind-numbingly boring to watch, but when sped up using the time-lapse feature, they allow everyday people like me to showcase the wonders of nature just like how the professional movies and television nature programs use time-lapse photography.   VideoStudio Pro lets me use both standard definition and HD videos, and editing, authoring, and burning of both video types is easy. The software is very flexible in importing videos from your hard drive or capturing them directly from your video recorders. There are flexible options for viewing your files in different ways such as timeline or storyboard modes, which are useful for adding videos, pictures, text, audio and music tracks. You can also trim or split your video into sections for better continuity, adding transitions and enhancing with many kinds of built-in effects. Once you upload your video, you can trim and divide the video into clips. Trimming is marking the beginning and ending of an entire clip, while multi-trimming is useful to divide one segment into multiple clips. Multi-trimming is very useful for editing out various parts of a recorded video to exclude sections that are boring or extraneous. This software's trimming functions are powerful and very easy to use, allowing me to feel like a Hollywood film director while I edit my videos to make them flow seamlessly between different scenes.   As with previous versions of VideoStudio, you can import photos to create a photo slideshow along with adding text and music accompaniment. The software is very flexible for adding music or audio voiceovers to your video projects from a variety of sources. You can add audio to your projects in Corel VideoStudio Pro X4 using various methods such as adding audio files to the library from your hard drive, ripping music from a CD, or recording a voiceover clip. You can edit the audio clips using a built-in sound mixer to adjust the volume, length and duration, fade-in/fade-out, and apply various mixing and sound filter effects to the audio tracks. The video editor does limit you to six overlay video tracks along with your main video track, combined with up to two title tracks, a voice track, and three music tracks. While this is less than some video-editing software that lets you incorporate many dozens of tracks, it is more than sufficient for the vast majority of everyday users (like me) who mainly work with personal videos and it is sufficient even for editing important events like videos of weddings and vacations.   After you have finished editing your video masterpiece in VideoStudio Pro, you can export in a variety of common formats including FLV files for YouTube, MPG (MPEG-1/MPEG-2), AVCHD, WMV HD, Windows Media, RealMedia, AVI, and QuickTime. You also have the option to upload your work to Vimeo, Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube. The software can create menus for DVD, Blu-ray, AVCHD, and it offers eight Blu-ray and twelve DVD menu choices. This X4 version also adds new 3D video capabilities. Even though I admit that I am a 3D video editing newbie, this feature seems limited and fairly rudimentary in its 3D rendering options, but it can create some pretty cool eye-popping 3D effects and is easy to use. This will NOT get you the kind of 3D video that Hollywood can create, but it does add another dimension of ""eye candy Wow factor"" to your videos. Just don't expect to create your own version of an ""Avatar 3D"" movie. 3D glasses are included with the software.   The ""Ultimate"" version of VideoStudio Pro X4 includes proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization software that really makes a noticeable difference to stabilize and remove the shake from my videos, which I mostly shoot hand-held.   Ergonomics, Usability & Ease of Use:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating   The PaintShop Pro user interface now features three separate, yet integrated, workflow interfaces, designated by tabs across the top of the program window: ""Manage"", ""Adjust"", ""Edit"". The ""Photo Organizer"" in previous versions is now replaced by an ""Organizer"" palette which is available from all three workflow tabs.   The PaintShop Pro ""Manage"" tab is where you browse, review, and rate images, edit metadata, and create collections of photos. This workspace lets you review and organize your photo files. Using the navigation palette, you can select an entire photo folder on your computer, narrow the selection according to one or more tags that you have assigned to photos, or narrow the selection according to the ratings that you have assigned to photos. The palette also shows basic EXIF information about a photo.   The PaintShop Pro ""Adjust"" tab is where you can make photo adjustments using a subset of the most common tools such as sharpening, color balance, brightness/contrast, fill light, clarity, tone mapping, noise removal, cropping, straightening, red-eye removal, or using its various built-in touch-up tools. Edits can also be applied to batches of files. This tab only offers a portion of the tools that are all available from the ""Edit"" tab. Its interface is cleaner and far less busy than the ""Edit"" tab, and because of its simpler layout, it makes an ideal interface for beginning users who are just starting to learn the software.   The PaintShop Pro ""Edit"" tab includes all of the entire sets of tools for photo editing, drawing, painting, and graphic design work. By contrast, the ""Adjust"" tab offers only a subset of what can be accessed from the ""Edit"" tab. I think of the ""Adjust"" tab as being designed for novice newbies and beginning-intermediate levels of users, who often are not exactly sure what is wrong with their photo and how specifically to correct/adjust it, and the ""Edit"" tab is designed for advanced power users like me who want to have direct access to all the tools. If you are just starting out with graphics software, I recommend that you begin your photo editing from the ""Adjust"" tab, and then later as you become more proficient with the software, you can ignore this tab and always proceed directly to the ""Edit"" tab. The ""Adjust"" tab is much cleaner with its presentation of tools grouped into a handful of categories on the left side of the user interface and four menu options along the top, whereas the ""Edit"" tab lets you access every possible tool in its comprehensive tool chest and eleven menu options along the top. Overall, I think that this three-tab design strikes a happy balance that addresses the needs of both new users and power users.   While the PaintShop Pro ""Manage"" and ""Adjust"" tabs are more simpler, clean, and organized in their user interface layouts, the ""Edit"" tab feels very busy and crowded, and it can be hard to find tools, especially when you are initially familiarizing yourself with all of the software's dozens of tools. And to add to this ergonomics and usability issue, the main menu on the ""Edit"" tab divides the tools into two menu options: 'Adjust' and 'Effects'. The ""Adjust"" tab includes a subset of options that are listed under the 'Adjust' menu option on the ""Edit"" tab. One ambiguous example is that under the 'Adjust' main menu option of the ""Edit"" tab, there is a 'Brightness and Contrast' option that then opens up a submenu containing the new 'Fill Light/Clarity' tool. But the 'Adjust' menu also lists a similar tool called 'Fill Flash'. Both the 'Fill Light/Clarity' and 'Fill Flash' tools have a similar function, but neither the printed User Manual nor the online ""Help Topics"" documentation explain what the differences between both tools are. At a minimum, the 'Fill Flash' tool also needs to be moved into the submenu below the 'Brightness and Contrast' option. Ideally, both 'Fill Flash', which has 'Strength' and 'Saturation' slider settings, and 'Fill Light/Clarity', which has 'Fill Light' and 'Clarity' slider settings, should be combined into a single tool window containing three or four sliders, instead of confusing users as to which of these two tools to use.   I like the changes and improvements that Corel has made to VideoStudio Pro X4. I can resize, drag, dock, and undock various windows and UI elements to suit my workspace preferences and everything seems to behave intuitively. But as with how Corel has designed their help system for PaintShop Pro X4 software, the one aspect of the VideoStudio Pro X4 user interface that I really dislike is that to access the help menus, I am forced to hop through intermediate menus before it launches the online help from Corel's Web site using my browser. With both PaintShop Pro X4 and VideoStudio Pro X4, I now just bookmark the help information URLs and access them directly from my browser instead of clicking the cumbersome help button from within the application. Even though the latest and most up-to-date online help information can be dynamically accessed directly from Corel's Web site when using this browser approach, I would still really prefer the previous approach of at least being given the option during the installation of the software to load the full help documentation on my computer's local hard drive since that also gives me the freedom to access the user manuals and help guides when I use the software without having Internet access.   VideoStudio Pro is a big complex software application that really requires some patience for you to slowly become more familiar with all of its features and power. But its user interface is cleanly designed so that newbie first-timers can start editing their videos with ease without fully mastering all of its powerful features. Fortunately, Corel also provides plenty of online help along with easy-to-use templates and more than 60 really cool special effects and more than 150 transition effects to let you experiment and try out many of its flexible options so even video-editing newbies can create a polished slick video with ease. The software uses a nondestructive editing approach so that your original video file is not being directly modified along the way. This also allows you to experiment, even trying out wacky ideas and special effects, turning a tedious chore into a fun playtime of creating video eye candy.   Performance, Stability & Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating   Compared to previous versions of PaintShop Pro, this X4 version has pretty good stability. During almost one year of weekly usage before writing this review, I have had the software crash or hang about 6 times total, and this includes running the software on an old underpowered Windows Vista laptop and a tiny Windows 7 Dell Mini 10 netbook. Corel has obviously worked on adding stability with this version, along with GPU optimizations.   Speed has been noticeably improved, the performance is considerably faster than previous versions, start-up time to launch the program for the first time has been improved, and these improvements are especially apparent when running PaintShop Pro X4 on an older slower computer. When used on my 5-year old Windows Vista laptop with 2GB memory, applying most effects happens in real-time, and for some operations such as adjusting sharpening parameters on 100-MB TIFF image files, the pop-up preview window will still display a progress meter, but these progress meters only last for a few seconds on this older laptop of mine.   PaintShop Pro X4 now requires only 1GB of disk space. The previous PaintShop Pro X3 version required 3GB of disk space, which tells me that prior to X4, PaintShop Pro had become very bloated and disorganized. So this redesign both increased performance and reduced the disk space required. By comparison, Adobe's latest Photoshop Elements 10 requires a whopping 3GB to 4GB of disk space, even though it has less features and effects than PaintShop Pro X4.   With this VideoStudio Pro X4 version, Corel continues to add new features and useful enhancements, important bug fixes and crucial improvements to software stability, along with performance and speed boosts by taking advantage of Intel's and AMD's new CPUs and also GPU acceleration provided by specific Nvidia graphics processors.   One really cool performance feature offered by VideoStudio Pro is that it has a ""Smart Proxy"" editing mode, where you can edit high-definition video in a low-resolution mode, thereby allowing you to use a slower computer without necessarily slowing down to a sluggish crawl. These performance enhancements offer a huge advantage because many of us do not upgrade our computers frequently with the latest fastest CPU processors. So some of the other brands of video editing software may be unbearably slow on these slower computers (even to the point of completely freezing up) while VideoStudio Pro X4 can still zip along with a decent amount of responsiveness on slower computers.   Back when I was using VideoStudio Pro X2, the software had various erratic and quirky bugs and serious stability issues; it can be disheartening to have the software freeze up after you have spent more than an hour editing a video. Many of these problems have thankfully been resolved in this VideoStudio Pro X4; not once did I encounter a freeze-up or crash during my edits using X4. When used on an older slower Windows Vista laptop of mine, the software can be sluggishly slow sometimes, but I prefer dealing with slower performance on a slower computer than having to deal with annoying software bugs and applications that freeze up or crash on me, so I accept the fact that I have to wait longer when using VideoStudio Pro X4 on a slower laptop that is more than four years old. As with any video editing software, especially when editing HD videos, your best experience will result from using a fast computer with lots of memory.   Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating   At the time of this review's writing, PaintShop Pro X4 Ultimate is being discounted on Amazon at a price less than $90.  For less than $100, there is currently no other commercial software that even comes close to the photo and video editing power and features that are offered in this fully-loaded bundle.   Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:  For overall bang-for-the-buck combination of very affordable value and feature-packed power in a commercial photo-editing software package, PaintShop Pro X4 currently reigns supreme, beating out Adobe Photoshop Elements 10 and all other photo-editing software that I can think of. If you want something even less expensive, look into a freeware graphics software called ""GIMP"" which offers a ton of graphics editing power for free. And if you have no experience with graphics software or if you do not want to spend time learning its complexities, look into the free and easy-to-use software called ""Paint. NET"".  Despite the significant performance improvements in version X4 (I think that it is roughly 50% to 100% faster than X3 and also more stable), it still does have its slow areas of laggardly performance. In particular, this is not a good software for processing RAW files, both due to its slow RAW converter and due to its limited RAW compatibility. But now that Corel has repackaged Bibble Lab's ""Bibble Pro"" as their ""AfterShot Pro"" software, you should consider ""AfterShot Pro"" for your RAW file processing; Bibble had one of the fastest RAW converters and Corel acquired Bibble Labs to compete with Adobe's Lightroom.  If you want the deluxe photo management and editing solution, deluxe in capability, cost, and complexity, using Adobe's Lightroom and Photoshop CS are the way to go. Otherwise, this PaintShop Pro X4 is an excellent ""Photoshop for the masses"" alternative. If you primarily shoot in RAW, adding Corel's new AfterShot Pro allows for great RAW handling followed by photo editing in PaintShop Pro X4. And if Corel's HDR feature in PaintShop Pro X4 has whetted your appetite for HDR processing, you should seriously consider getting Photomatix Pro (currently at version 4) since its capabilities exceed anything that Corel or Adobe has to offer.  While the VideoStudio Pro X4 included in this bundle lacks some of the features and has more track-editing limitations when compared to both CyberLink PowerDirector and Adobe Premiere, I think that it beats those two when it comes to multi-trim clip editing, key framing, and its best-in-class stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities. And VideoStudio Pro X4 is far easier and more intuitive to learn for a newbie compared to Adobe Premiere's dense complexity. If this video-editing software was priced at $300, I would rate it 4 stars or maybe 3.5 stars, but with its inexpensive list price and Corel's frequent heavy pricing discounts, I rate it 5 star",1076

7351.0,489,4.0,"I've had issues with Corel products in the past: I've aways WANTED to like them, but they've always somehow missed the mark. VideoStudio Pro, though, I like quite a bit.  It walks a fine line quite well, packing in a ton of prosumer-level features like excellent stop-motion, motion tracking, variable speed controls and HTML5 support while staying fairly straightforward and easy to learn. So beginners can jump right in and make movies without fear of outgrowing the package too quickly.  I found the interface fairly clean and easy to navigate, though there were moments when it didn't seem entirely intuitive. However, given the flexibility that VideoStudio Pro offers, this is really not a complaint as much as an observation; there has to be give and take to find balance here. You work in one of three modes: capture, edit, or share - I like this approach, as it keeps everything quite clear for beginners and more advanced users alike.  VideoStudio easily handles pretty much any format I've thrown at it, and it can even work with Ultra HD-4K, something that competing products in this price range cannot (good news for GoPro Hero3 Black owners!).  Clip organization is mediocre: a lack of tagging can hobble users' ability to easily find what they're looking for, but the rest of the package is quite good. Editing can be done in a basic drag-and-drop style for those looking to get something together quickly and easily, but far more advanced editing is available when you need it. Overall, I prefer the VideoStudio editing experience to Sony Vegas Platinum's.  I personally dislike most transitions, but if you're NOT like me you'll be psyched: there are a ton of them. A really nice selection of effects is available as well (some work better than others, as one might expect), though an upgrade to VideoStudio Ultimate X6 nets a few more that approach real pro quality; the price difference is only a couple of bucks and I'd recommend looking at it.  As I said, I think Corel has struck a great balance here. Beginners can jump in and start editing quickly, while more advanced users can stretch their legs and do some very advanced things. If your budget is under a hundred bucks for a video editing package and you want something that you won't hit the limits of too quickly (particularly if you're able to shoot in 4K), it's tough to go wrong with VideoStudio Pro X6.",927

8472.0,547,5.0,"I've been using TurboTax for many years and this year's is the easiest yet. The flow is pretty much the same as it has been for a while, with your choice of a series of questions or just going to the parts you know you need. One thing I have noticed over the past few years is that the option to import from Quicken seems to be downplayed - unlike in some earlier years, I was never asked about importing though I later found where I could do that. It did keep asking me about downloading data from financial institutions, but I liked that after three times saying ""no"", it gives me the option to say ""don't ask again"".  E-filing is a snap, though when I filed for my mother-in-law, who died last year, the program was indecisive as to whether or not I could E-File. (I couldn't, as it told me in one area.)

11609.0,742,4.0,"I installed the Magix video editing program on a large DELL desktop machine, a Studio/XPS 9000 i7 quad core with 24gigs of RAM, and a ATI Radeon HD 5800 Series graphics card with 1 gig of dedicated video memory (my C: program and cache disk is an 1TB SSD).  The installation program asked if I wanted to ALSO install Simpliclean (a register booster and register cleaning tool)  I said NO.  I have other tools already that I know and trust; Simpliclean is one I have not used before, and it felt like bloatware.  During installation  messages talked about some of the features that I might want to be aware of, including --  Stabilization  Object Tracking (of objects on in the scenes)  Mobile Video Editing for (or on?) Android  A sound archive for slideshows and videos  Sound editing  Showfy for sharing (hmm, Id rather use YouTube or Facebook directly)  The latest offers, always up to date (hmm, it better not try and sell me something every time I turn around, like Pinnacle products do!)  It made me close MS Outlook for the installation to work (it actually stopped during the installation and complained that Outlook was running, and asked me to close it thats a first! - Im not sure what it would be messing with that Outlook would also be using)  The online registration was easy  using the supplied very long key code, I did have to give it my name, email etc., to create an account with them, but thats no big deal to me.  I then ran the program, and found their _Demo project and clicked on it, (just a hunch that was the right file) and wow, it loaded up the timeline with the tracks and fades and transitions, picture in picture, show-speed, fast-speed, etc., all very nice.  I played the demo project on and watched the timeline, to see how this thing works.  * NOTE, I usually use Cyberlinks video editing products for most of my projects, but I also have Pinnacles products, and Adobe CS6 and Sony products too, along with ProShow Producer, so Im familiar with how video editing companies think, and thus how they build their editing tools, so with a little trial and error, I was able to navigate around Magix without any trouble.  I will say that on my PC, the live playback within the editing tool window was very good, better than Cyberlinks (once Cyberlink creates the shadow files, then things get better for real time editing and real time play back on the screen while you are editing, but its still not as good as I was seeing here with the Magix product!)  That was cool!  I do feel that the world probably has enough video editing tools, so seeing this one made me think, oh well, another mouse trap, and this one is probably better in some respects than the more popular Adobe and more established products such as those from Cyberlink or Pinnacle or Sony, but competition is good, and this will force the others to get better too.  Yes, there are YouTube videos for help (no printed manual comes with this product, but then no one reads those anyways).  However, theres a lot more on YouTube by professional and amateur people on how to do things in the other more established and de facto products, so while this one is good, it might not matter the others have more info on them already.  If youve never used one of these programs before, this one is very powerful, has all the nice options, but the learning curve will be steep to master all the options.  I will keep this one, and add it to my collection.  I liked the easy way that it handled speeding up or slowing down video within a track (and, I will look harder now at the other products that I have to see if they can do that as easily too).  Sometimes Ive done this the long and hard way, by making a clip, slowing it down, and then including that slowed down clip within a project.  Thats a lot of steps, whereas Magix made this look as easy as adding a fade or transition!  Cool!",1066

11579.0,740,4.0,"This program initially seems more similar in style to Mavis Beacon Typing than Rosetta Stone. Rosetta Stone wastes no time grading your word pronunciation and feels more immersive right off the bat.  Instant Immersion initially starts out grading you based upon how many modules you complete. Eventually, you'll get to sections where you're required to understand the words and select the correct answers to be graded accordingly.  It's initially a little confusing to self-navigate.  Thankfully, the PDF help system will get you up to speed.  The lessons are entertaining and like every other program out there, Rosetta Stone included, your success will most ly depend on your level of commitment to truly learning by doing.  If you simply run through the paces and expect to magically know Spanish at the end, you'll be disappointed.  This is true whether you spend $30 on a program or $300.  In addition to the software application, Instant Immersion also bundles in a companion iOS/Android app, a conventional DVD with additional practice lessons and online access to lessons.  It's a very well-rounded package and absolutely worth the price.  In fact, I would suggest starting with this before dropping a few hundred on more an expensive program.  I've used everything from the cheapest bargain bin language programs to the biggest bundle Rosetta Stone offers.

6963.0,462,5.0,"This demo was a just in time program.  My youngest daughter was in a ballet recital but a few days before the recital she fell and cut open her head.  That left a nasty wound that the ballet instructor asked us to cover with a minimal band aid.  Needless to say, we could not find a band aid so we tried to brush her hair to the side to cover.  It worked a little but in all the pictures this larger than life cut showed up very prominent.  It just so happened that the software arrived the day before so I loaded it onto my MacBook Pro and without reading through the instructions started playing with the program to see what it could do.  It was very easy to load and I was up and running in about 10 minutes after registering.  I loaded in my pictures and began to work with them, consulting the 114 page user's guide as I was going through the pictures.  After two bad starts I figured out which aspect of the program fixed images and wiped away blemishes and such.  In about 5 minutes I had figured out how to remove the wound from the image and place exact skin tone right over the spot.  I touched it up with a brush feature and then went about brightening their eyes and whitening their teeth, both of which were very easy to figure out without using the guide.  The final product was fantastic and my wife an I can't be more pleased and out daughter loved looking at her image without the cut.  For a program to load, be up and running and finish in less than 30 minutes is wonderful.  The smart patch is what I used along with the eye fix and teeth whitening.  I then spent some time going over other aspects of the program, such as body shaping, coloration, sharpening and blending and have to say I am very, very impressed with this software.

I can't say that it has fixed anything, but it isn't causing any conflicts or lag time in any of the machines, which is a huge plus. I can say that it did seem to take quite a bit of time to install-more time then I would prefer-but I guess that is probably a good sign that it is installing a lot of preventitive and protective programs.  Despite taking a bit of time to get the three computers installed with this program, I have had no REAL trouble aside from the program becoming unresponsive yesterday for no apparent reason. It caused a shut down of my internet explorer that I THOUGHT was a good sign (I figured it was something to do with an unsafe site I may have been on?) but then I wound up having one of those nightmarish error messages telling me, ""Trend Micro Internet Security has become unresponsive and will now close"" or something along those lines. I am still not sure what that was about-but I didn't really feel that great about it afterwards since the little red icon was missing and I was, at that point, unprotected from threats.  Overall, the ease of use is very simple and comprehendible for any beginner. Very, very easy to use. I like the Pro tool features-especially the system tuner, which cleared out over 400 Mb's of unwanted temporary files and unused programs.  As someone who is constantly plagued by viruses, I can't really grade this THAT accurately as of now. I have only had it for a week, but so far, it has performed fairly well. It seems to be a bit more steady and reliable then my former McAfee internet security suite (which froze on me ALL the time!).  I am also a little confused about the virus scanning on this. I have an additional program called Spysweeper which picked up a trojan on my computer a couple days ago, while this went unaware. That makes me a TINY bit nervous. I am not sure why this didn't grab the file first or stop it from entering before I even performed the spysweep program? Strange. Oh well! This is a decent program to help aid in computer performance and stability.  I think, if you are looking for a program you can get multiple computer uses out of, get this one.

9263.0,591,5.0,"In the beginning, there was Norton, specifically  Peter Norton who brought the world Norton Utilities in the early 80s, the first hugely successful package of PC utilities which would do wondrous things like recover accidentally deleted files. Norton AntiVirus wasn't far behind. Norton wrote books, produced utility software and in 1990 sold out to Symantec.   Over the years Norton AntiVirus in particular became a go-to product.   It also became bloated, buggy and slow and a lot of people, including me, migrated to more agile products.   I have several older computers that needed to be protected, but I didn't necessarily want to spring for the price of BitDefender. So I figured I would try Norton again. After all, I could always uninstall it, which I did with several prior versions.   This time, though, I don't think so.   Norton, for Windows at least, is back in fighting trim. There is no physical media in the package. Just a card with a keycode. You have to go online to the Norton site to download the product. By the way, this package permits you to install the product7 on give machines, which may be Windows, Mac OS, Apple iOS or Android. I am using it only with Windows. The Apple iOS and Android offerings look weak. Also, the one-year subscription term begins with installation on the first computer, so be sure to do all the computers you plan to protect at about the same time. Ill be protecting five older Windows computers with this package.   On n Intel i7 equipped computer, I am very pleasantly surprised so far. Installation was simple, fast and without problem. The User Interface, which at first looks way too simple, is actually quite sophisticated. Scans were very fast and efficient. Norton includes usage meters so you can clearly see how much CPU and RAM Norton is using. The impact according to the Norton meters and eyeball observation is minimal, a far cry from the last versions of Norton I used several years back.   Overall, I am very impressed by this Norton and feel no hesitation in going ahead and installing it on another four Windows computers.  Jerry",564

Now that being said I have one recommendation: Even though at this point in time I am very familiar with how this tax program flows I do carefully read each step in the interview and answer each question carefully. This little detail will insure you get the forms and pages you need. If you do miss something you will not get the page you need. You will have to go back and hunt it down. You are better off saying yes to a question you are not sure of. You can always skip the part when you get to it. This year I may actually use the download function for some financial firms like Fidelity to save me manually keying in all the data. Much easier to verify and be done with it.

2530.0,213,4.0,"PhotoPlus X2 is a very good photo editor. It is operates in a similar manner to Photoshop in many aspects though it is not as powerful as CS3 or CS4.  PhotoPlus X2 is similar in features and power to Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 Ultimate.  Both programs are more powerful than Photoshop Elements versions 6 or 7.  An additional bonus of PhotoPlus X2 not offered with Paint Shop Pro is compatibility with 3rd party Photoshop plugins.  Pros:  Basic editing such as color adjustment, sharpening, lens filters, cloning etc are easy to find and use.  Photo resizing is excellent - the best that I have seen!  (I am referring to taking a small photo and doubling it in size.  Most programs leave the photo in a fuzzy condition.  PhotoPlus X2 somehow doubles the photos with less fuzziness.)  The lens vignette function is really a nice feature to have.  If you use a polarized filter, often times the sky on one side of the photo will be much darker than the other side.  The lens vignette function largely eliminates this problem.  Cons:  The sharpen slider in the Quickfix studio works in chunks rather than in a linear fashion - 0,50 etc.  You must type in a sharpen amount in the box next to the slider and then sharpen in a linear fashion - 28,29,30,31 etc.  Serif verified this bug in Sept 08.  The makeover studio requires several steps similar to Adobe Photoshop - creation of editing masks.  Paintshop Pro Photo X2 Ultimate thankfully does not require the creation of masks to do makeover tasks.  All in all an excellent photo editor that will generally run quite nicely on older hardware - Pentium 4, 3ghz with 3gb of ram.",518
1407.0,97,3.0,"I gave it a middle-of-the road rating at this point because it turns out the version I bought is a ""hybrid"" version, which I didn't know at that the time of purchase.  The disk is a genuine Microsoft disk.  I called Microsoft tech support and asked what is a ""hybrid.""  Below is a link to what the Professional 2007 hybrid was.  Tech Support said ""hybrid"" was a download and not a disk.  It did activate and I do have a product key.  The Tech thought I may be okay. Until the program started to reinstall every time I opened it, I had no idea that this was a hybrid version and the sealed package doesn't disclose this fact.  I fixed the reinstall problem by entering ""regedit"" in the search box (under the start button in Windows 7), right clicked to run it as Administrator, under HKEY_Current_User, Software,Microsoft, Office, 12.0, then clicked on the individual programs (e.g., Word), right clicked in the blank area to the right for ""new"", then selected DWord, renamed it ""NoReReg"", then modified the value from ""0"" to ""1"".  This took care of the Windows Installer trying to reinstall these programs every time I started using them for that day.  Now I have my fingers crossed that all is well with this Microsoft Office Professional 2007 Full Version.  Most of the businesses in our area still use 2007 and 2010, so I wanted to learn those systems; otherwise, if it were just for my personal and home business use, I'd probably go with 2013 or 365.  Buying older software from resellers is still a risky business.  Hope this info helps.  UPDATE:  My seller hadn't heard of a ""hybrid"" version either but he offered to refund my money.

He wants to be a video game designer when he grows up and from the reviews we read this would be a great starting point, but by no means a professional tool for selling your own games.  We selected Animae Studio Pro 8 because it was more user friendly than what a lot of other programs seemed to offer. There are a LOT of free tutorials online, through YouTube, and trouble shooting tips all over google's search engine. He managed to pick up basics in just a few days and created a short in about a week.

It didn't crash and it seemed to be doing a fair, but not excellent job of keeping away the things I expect it to keep away.  It installed easily and doesn't require a lot of manual maintenance. It has blocked a few ""dangerous"" web sites which I suppose is a good thing.  Here's the rub - I receive more than 300 emails daily. 90%+ are spam. My main desire from a product of this nature is that it block spam. McAfee did a better job than both Kaspersky and Norton in this respect, but it is still lacking. When I use the trainer buttons to indicate that a product is spam, I expect that the product, and similar spams, will never again appear in my in-box. McAfee does not deliver in this matter. While I probably receive an 85% percent spam reduction, I probably still have to spend 2-3 minutes a day manually adding spam to the ""this is spam"" button. That's fairly irritating. Other than that, I feel protected by the product.",682
9945.0,628,1.0,"Im sure if TurboTax runs properly, its an enjoyable experience.  But if it doesnt, theres no recourse but to live with the softwares inadequacies.  TurboTax offers no absolutely helpnone that I was able to access.  So a frustrated user gets to the point of just paying extra taxes rather than doing maddeningly hopeless battle with TurboTax for more hours.  Im sure I overpaid at least $200 in federal tax this year, and overpaid a smaller amount in state taxtaxes that I didn't owe, and I might have avoided had TurboTax software run error-freeor if any help whatsoever were available.  I had two problems this yearother problems previous years, none ever resolved.  First, TurboTax would not let me enter the costs of vehicle registration.  Each time I tried, the program crashed.  I tried several times; I shut down and restarted, but each time I tried to enter vehicle registration costs, the program crashed.  I gave up.  The amounts were relatively small.  More significant were carry-over losses from stock-sales.  TurboTax would not enter this information because the program claimed my password was incorrect.  I was almost certain it wasn't incorrect; Id made careful notes from the previous year.  Nonetheless, I went through TurboTaxs change of password procedures.  When I got to the appropriate screen I entered a new password, and reentered it for verification, and I got a cheery little response: Your password has been successfully changed.  But it hadnt been.  TurboTax refused to accept the new password.  I tried the procedure again and again.  Again and again I was told my password had been reset.  But it never had been; TurboTax steadfastly refused the password, and refused to enter carry-over losses.  What I felt was interesting is that the problem I was having is evidently a common one, or so it would seem because TurboTax has a response button for exactly this problem.  That is, there is a pop-up button that suggests: If you have changed your password, but TurboTax still refuses to recognize your password, click here.  I did.  It took me to some advertisements for Intuit products.  The friendly TurboTax programmers must be roaring with laughter over that one.  But if a problem is common enough to merit a specific button, why not just fix the bug?  The answer to that question hints at TurboTaxs attitude toward its customers, I suspect.  If there is any way to get help from the folks at TurboTax, I sure haven't found it.  I think Id have more luck to have a prayer for a mega-lottery win answered.  When I finished my excess tax statement this year, TurboTax asked if Id like a copy save.  I responded, yes.  I was asked for my password, and then was told again that it was still wrong.  TurboTax should have a button at this point: Dare you still want to try to change you password, Sucker?  Abandon all hope yea who enter here.  I won't be using TurboTax next year if I can find any remotely suitable option.  Its far less frustrating to fill out the forms on paper.",427

9486.0,604,4.0,"Corel PaintShop Pro X7: What I didn't like; it took forever to install and register. I was able to install two other programs in less time than it took to install and register this program. I'm still not sure it actually did register. I entered my email address and it went to a white screen suggesting it was registering, but that was it. It took about 5 minutes to install. The first time I tried to open it, it wouldn't open. I got a blank dialog box and after several minutes I closed that and tried again. Finally it did open. Once I did get everything working I tried to see the so called video tutorials. It took me online and there were tutorials on how to use my camera to take better pictures, but anything to do with learning this program took me to places where I could purchase stuff, online lessons or additional filters. It was easy enough to figure out without the lessons and there is an online manual that can be downloaded. I like that you can use the simple, one step fix and it will evaluate your photo and adjust it for you. You can also use layers, like you can with Adobe, to do more professional photo editing. It has a full array of features to do just about anything you can think of. The ability to do all sorts of fancy text editing is really fun. You can put your photo onto text, it's fun. It also have a share button that lets you upload your photo to social media like FB and Google + I installed the program on a windows 7 laptop. I like that it takes up less space than some of the other full feature photo editing programs. I was able to access photos on my other computers via the open and selecting my network, no hesitation or problem. I have had issues with other similar programs not being able to get onto my other computers. After the frustration of installation, it is a fun, easy to use, full featured photo editing program.

2035.0,139,4.0,"I am a long time TurboTax user, and Premier this year shows progress from previous years in most areas. Importing W-2 and some investment data is a breeze, although several mutual fund entries had to be made manually. I found that switching between the interview and forms was less than optimum this year: the forms menu was touchy and hard to navigate accurately, and annoyingly, was not complete.  One huge oversight is that form 1040-V, which anyone who owes tax needs (although you can technically file without it), is apparently missing in action. It did not print with my return, and when I went to forms it is not even in the list, making a trip to the IRS web site necessary to manually find, print, and fill out the form. Strangely, the corresponding form for my state taxes did print with my return and was accurate. TurboTax also had an issue with my state taxes when it wouldn't accept an entry I made (correctly) from a 1099-R. It insisted a certain number (a state tax ID number) had to be seven digits long, yet the number (which the payer, Fidelity Investments, confirmed) was nine digits long on the 1099-R. TurboTax would not allow me to overwrite the field, and I had to write a cover letter to file along with my state taxes (which necessitated paper filing). The program also lacks a decent search function. I had a complex issue involving a payment taken as stock which I had to research completely on my own (the J. K. Lasser book is still a great tool to have on hand). I also find that for both the 2006 and 2007 tax years TurboTax is inflexible about keeping your files in anything but PDF format, which I consider to be a major inconvenience.  Overall I still find TurboTax the best self-preparation tool on the market, but it is not without its frustrations. I recommend the program, but caution that if you have complex returns, TurboTax is not a perfect tool and has some subtle flaws that pester the user.",499

6409.0,427,4.0,"Let's just get right to it:  PROS: Plays Blu-ray Discs, 3D movies, and DVDs. Plays other media from your computer. Can display non-3D video and photos in 3D, though your mileage may vary. Easy install. Comes with a very nice pair of anaglyph 3D glasses.  CONS: Bulky and bloated. Takes up a lot of space and loads slowly even on very fast PCs. Retail version still has advertisement in the way of little pop-ups that ask you to upgrade. Slow reaction when it comes to movie controls, sometimes. Accessing additional controls (interlace, subtitles, color, etc.) is more complicated than other options.  THE DETAILS: I use PowerDVD 12 for two things: When I want to watch a Blu-ray Disc on my computer, and when I want to watch a normal 2D movie or slideshow in 3D, using PowerDVD's pseudo-3D enhancement. The 3D enhancement really does work, though it is a bit inconsistent and you'll find some things in the background popping out, instead of things in the foreground. It's still a cool effect, and the glasses they include are rather nice for anaglyph 3D glasses; They're plastic, with real hinges on the temples, and of decent build quality.  But when it comes to video playback in 2D, unless it's a Blu-ray Disc, I still prefer to use VLC (VideoLAN) for my movie-watching needs. It's faster, easier to control, and doesn't pester me with pop-ups at startup asking me to look into other upgrades and features. VLC is also free, and gives fine control over the video color, quality, and features in the contextual menu-- Something PowerDVD 12 lacks. You can start the journey toward tweaking controls and appearance in PowerDVD 12's contextual menu, but that just takes you to a large pop-over menu that has limited features.  In short, PowerDVD 12 is made for people who just want to pop in a disc and have it play automatically without any tweaking or customizing. It's not made for people who like to customize their experience. That being said, it's still an excellent way to play Blu-ray Discs on your PC, and the 3D feature is kind of cool for those of us who haven't invested in a 3D HDTV yet.  PowerDVD is well worth having around if you enjoy Blu-ray Discs. If you're looking for something to play video files, photo slideshows, music, and DVDs, though, I'd recommend either VLC or J. River Media Center 16. Both manage these other tasks faster and more efficiently than PowerDVD does, currently, and do it without the nags, retail links, and resource hogging found in PowerDVD 12.  VERDICT:  The best Blu-ray Disc player for Windows, but ""average to slow"" for other tasks.",542
10193.0,644,4.0,"I have taught 5 children to read now, all of which are advanced for their age.  I've used Reader Rabbit and other programs as a fun supplement to the reading book I use. This one is super nice!  It keeps it interesting and laid back, and I am using it for my advanced learner (stage 4 of 4 in the program) along with my beginning reader. And my preschooler can also play with the first level even though I haven't worked with her on actual reading yet. So the value is good for three children.  Content is easy to navigate through and I found it to be very well done.  But now to the cons of the program. First, I thought this was a disc. It's not... Its only 1 year of access to their online program. I found it super expensive. I wanted something I could use for years and OFFLINE. Not something I have to watch to make sure they don't accidentally browse the internet.  They really should offer the software for a one time price.  For those with a limited budget, I suggest Starfall, you can get it on disc for about $15 or use their online program for free. Its not as comprehensive though.

10039.0,633,4.0,"I have used a different program for cards for years and years . . . . but I got a new computer and it would not load, so I decided to give this one a try.  There are lots of cards to choose from.  For the most part its easy to tweak the cards the way you want them, after you get used to using the program.  Honestly, its not super user friendly, but again, once you get used to it, its not a big deal.  You can print them as half-fold, or 4X6.  Note that you will not see the 4X6 option until to actually start to print the card.  Unfortunately, its impossible to search for things.  There is a search feature, but it doesnt work.  For example:  You want to add some balloons from the clip art section.  So you type balloon in the search box.  Absolutely nothing comes-up.  Another example:  You want to search all cards, so you click the search theme icon.  The type in travel.  Absolutely nothing comes-up.

3891.0,254,4.0,"Most people buying VMware Fusion 2 do so because they need (or want) to run Windows programs on their Mac, although you can use it to install any alternate operating system.  This virtual machine is incredibly easy to install and use.  It provides a set-up Wizard that takes the user step-by-step through its use, with tutorials, and through the installation of Windows or other operating system such as Linux.  The VM creates a separate machine environment in a single window; it looks like a desk top within a desk top, with Mac OS ""liquid"" buttons at the top and an exact replica (for lack of a better word) of the operating system start up screen.  Don't be fooled, however; this is not a Mac OS masquerading as Windows.  It is a complete version of the secondary operating system, with all its rules and procedures.  You can quit VM, but it will only suspend Windows.  To shut down the virtual machine, you have to click on the ""turn off computer"" button on the Windows desk top (it will not shut down your Mac, only Windows, which ""thinks"" it is its own computer).  To use Windows-environment programs, you must install them as though the VM screen is your actual computer.  At any time, you can return to the Mac environment by clicking outside the ""desk top"" screen.  This software is best for high-powered Macs.  Running two operating systems can tax your computer if it doesn't have the memory and speed to handle it.  My Mac Mini, with 2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo and 2 GB RAM, has no problem, although it doesn't have the necessary 3D graphics support, so that sometimes causes problems when running games.  And I've had a couple of Mac program crashes when Windows is trying to update itself.  Most times, however, this software runs smoothly and without issues.  The problems are minor compared to the advantages it offers, and most are due to Windows, not to VMware Fusion.  Especially for people who are making the switch between a PC and a Mac, this software offers the comfort of a familiar environment, with the ability to use the few programs made for Windows only.  The Mac OS is far superior to Windows, however, so don't make the mistake of continuing to buy Windows software just because you own VMware Fusion.  This program is made for those times when Windows is the only recourse.  Note:  Unless you have an installation CD for Windows, you'll have to buy that separately. <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Windows-XP-Home-Edition-FULL-VERSION-with-SP2/dp/B00022PTRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition FULL VERSION with SP2</a> <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Windows-XP-Professional-Full-Version-with-SP2/dp/B00022PTI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Windows XP Professional Full Version with SP2</a> <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Windows-Vista-Home-Premium-with-SP1-Upgrade/dp/B0013O54P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Windows Vista Home Premium with SP1 Upgrade</a>  -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",990

I set it up with Architecture settings because that is what I am most interested in, as someone who has been involved in restoring and renovating a hundred year old farmhouse-- forever.  I had been playing around with the program in terms of design but without really scratching the surface of what this program could do.  I put additions on our house and took them off.

I would have been able to use it for a lot more things had I understood it better.  My computers caused me a great deal of difficulty getting this program operational.  I had difficulty at first, because my computer was at the lower end of the requirements for RAM and was a little slower than necessary.  I added memory to the computer and that helped.  But then I tried installing Parallels and then Windows 7 on my MacBook Pro and found that most things I ran using that were a little sluggish, including this program.

But it doesn't offer any major advantages over free products for Android devices and other commercial offerings.    If you read the Norton Anti-Theft FAQ on the product website, you'll learn the product has some very significant limitations, such as being easily defeated by a computer-savvy thief or if the WiFi is turned off among other things.   The one year subscriptions for three devices starts when the first device is activated, so if you start one device and add another six months down the road, the second device is eligible for only six months of whatever protection is actually available.

4067.0,269,4.0,"I have been trying out a number of Corel products over the past year and cannot help but notice the trend simplicity, limited power (Corel Painter excepted, some true power utility there) or incompatibility with industry standards. [As a note, I am approaching this from the reference point of a prior career as a software engineer.]  With this product I had hoped to consolidate some of my disparate products that Corel had acquired over the past few years (PaintShop and ULead Video, mostly). Products that I have not upgraded because they still offer more than the replacement products currently offered by Corel. Subconsciously, I probably knew better. Software companies seldom bundle products without a reason, often because they are not selling enough of them separately and feel that they can get a little more mileage from a product by bundling it.  After testing through the elements of this suite, I have to say that the appropriate target audience is new/inexperienced users of photo/video editing software looking for a product that will give them the capability (albeit limited) to edit and organize their digital photos and videos. For that audience this product excels, any user with more experience will be left wanting.  I give the product 4 stars based upon its ability to fill the needs of what I assume is the target user, something that this product does well.

I prefer creating from scratch, I find it's sometimes a lot easier to get the effect I want.  At first when I started using PagePlus, I wasn't too sure about it. However, as I've gotten to use it more for making signs for my home or other projects, I've discovered what a wonderful gem PagePlus is. It's also been fun for making signs to post on Pinterest as well.  With all the cool features PagePlus offers to make good looking documents/signs at an incredibly low price, it's worth getting.

12586.0,435,4.0,"Peachtree accounting became known as Sage not too long ago. Peachtree has been a trusted name in accounting software for decades. I first used Peachtree software in the mid 90's for payroll purposes at a company I worked for at the time. I am primarily a Quickbooks user but I wanted to give Sage a shot. it is definitely a solid product and while I did not get to the point of using the payroll function, I was surprised to learn that payroll can no longer be entered even manually without a fee. I can understand a fee for the automated service but the fact that there is a charge even for entering it manually strikes me as a really bad and annoying idea. I am glad that I will not have to take that step as I will not be using this software for payroll, but please be advised that this will be an issue for those who do. otherwise, it seems like a well-planned out piece of software and I could certainly see myself using it on a daily basis (just not with any recurring fees)",506
4808.0,322,3.0,"I have been using DNS for almost 20 years, really! I depend on it to type for me.  The last two versions cause a hanging problem that Dragon has been incapable of fixing.  It is very frustrating. It works fine for a while then hangs/stalls.  The dufuses also put a part of the program in the temp directory.  I don't know if it happens on installation or training.  But if you ever clean your disks like you should of cookies, temps, etc, it looses something it needs. Who in their right mind stores important program files in a temp directory?!  It is also incompatible with certain Flash versions, and can screw up Firefox as well if you use one of those versions.  This is most likely Flash's fault.  I am computer proficient and have a powerful computer.  I reinstalled a few times,made a new user profile and tried solutions others suggested in their forums.  I can't believe they  have the nerve to try and charge such a high price for the upgrade to version 12.  People on their forums say version 12 has the same problem.  There is no excuse for such poor support for a program.  Do Not get it until you hear of a patch to fix the problems.  ******* OK it is time for an edit Farthion's comments about posting system specs is well made.  I agree.  However antivirus programs should have no afftect on Dragon because Dragon does not mess with the Windows Kernel, Although you should briefly disable your antivirus program before installing most programs.  Major change: I need to revise my review.  3 stars now instead of 1.  I just rebuilt my system (I do it myself), and I must acknowledge that Dragon works very well on it.  In fact it can keep up with me if I talk as fast as I can talk!  Yeah, after training, it's that fast.  It still has some minor quirks, but they are not that much of a problem.  You need a better mic than the one supplied, but you do not need a new microphone.  I have a quality 12-year-old Parrot, and it is working fine.  My new system has an Intel  i7 3820 CPU, 16 GB of fast RAM, Asus Rampage 4 Formula motherboard, and I'm booting Windows 8 on an SSD drive, which is also where I installed Dragon.  It is a gaming rig and work rig.  I've been testing DNS for almost a month now, and I happily acknowledge that it works very well, even on Windows 8.  (You can install the free program Classic Start Shell to get past the hideous Windows 8 Metro screen and get back the Windows start button).  But there are still two problems. In an effort to sell the product, Nuance drastically underestimates the system requirements.  Therefore they deserve the bad write-ups they get.  This program needs a powerful system, not as powerful as the one I built, but not as weak as the one Nuance would have you believe.  They require certain programs (ie Natspeak.exe and Flexnet) to access the internet every time the program runs.  It's a type of spyware.  Block them and the program screws up.  This is ridiculous.  Especially since their history for the past 10 years is to  only update once, about 6 months after the program comes out, with a service pack and never again.",1201
73.0,5,2.0,"I have Nolo products I bought in the past and I have used Quicken since their first version (I got it from the original owners of the company in person).  Nolo makes (made) some valuable applications but they tend to look like something you would find in MSDOS 3.0.  Quicken, on the other hand has a very slick and easy to understand user interface.  WillMaker Plus is very much a Nolo product. Although it contains the basic forms you buy it for, the user interface is so basic it looks like something you would find on PC's from the 1980's.  The willmaking app (the part that most people buy this for) consists of 7 questions.  Seriously, that's it. You are allowed to enter only what the software will let you enter and there are some really basic non-interactive guidelines that are at the same time too basic and also too confusing.  I wrote my own will in about 10 minutes, but the software didn't permit me to include ANY specific details for someone to know what my ""final intentions"" are. I can't imagine anyone having such a basic lifestyle as to just say ""give it all to so-and-so"".  I think anyone could just hand-write that sort of thing on a piece of paper and hand it to their next of kin.  I expected the software to be more like TurboTax in that it would interview me about what the provisions of my mortgage are, what and where my investments are, what and where my life insurance policies are, what I owe and how to pay that off, what special provisions I may have for friends who are not in my will but who I may want to leave certain things that they've admired to.  But no.  None of the above.  Just 7 questions and a print-out of something that to me really has no practical value.  I think Quicken is doing themselves a disservice to put their name on this product. It's not worth the 35 bucks and especially not worth the ""list price"" of 70. There are hundreds of websites you can go to and download a simple will form that will be just as useful to you as WillMaker Plus.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is that it does give you the convenience of having some basic forms all on one disk, a bit of a timesaver.

3602.0,230,4.0,"McAfee is a very easy Internet Security package to use.  I have not had any noticeable infiltrations on any of the machines, 1 XP pro laptops 1 XP pro tablet and 1 media PC tower, that it has been installed on.  In the past, I have predominantly used Norton products, but realized that it had a tendency to significantly reduce the performance of all machines I have installed them on.  AV suites are about as much protection as possible, but when my performance is cut almost in half, I had to look for an alternative.  Though I have used many different anti-virus and internet security suites over the years (Kaspersky, Trend Micro, AVG, etc.), for the purposes of this review, I am comparing only McAfee and Norton as I installed McAfee over the Norton installations.  Comparing the two, they have both worked well for me.  The main difference between McAfee and Norton is that McAfee is much more hands off.  Use the installer and the most current package is downloaded and then installed.  Once installed, it does its thing with very little setup or configuration.  Conversely, Norton came with a full version on the cd and after the install it asks to download the latest definitions and updates.  This route of install definitely took longer; and with the prevalence of high speed internet access that isn't that big of a deal --- of course it would be a big deal if you are still on dial up.  Norton also has a lengthy configuration process and while it ""learns"" your habits, pop ups and config questions constantly come on asking you to proceed, block, allow, accept, etc.  Not a big deal if you are fairly comfortable with computers, but people like my dad that only has basic skills were always afraid of doing the wrong thing so the first month I would always get a call asking me what to do.  In short, I like McAfee.  It works well and is easier to install and live with.  I would like a little more control over specific functions and task, that Norton does, but the ease of use and performance increase is well worth the sacrifice.",78

836.0,51,5.0,"Nancy Drew games have a long and proud history of having the user complete chores. It started early, in Message in a Haunted Mansion, and has been used poorly often (Trail of the Twister, Icicle Creek -- making the food, not the maid work, etc), but in this game it works. On a ranch, everyone pitches in. And really, the only thing you have to pitch in and do is collect eggs and vegetables, set up a camp fire, and feed the horses.  Actually, the camp fire was the only time I cheated, because I couldn't figure out where to get the kindling. I totally glanced over the true source because I thought it was part of the scenery, so I had a good laugh when I looked at the cheat. Don't make my mistake players. It's right in front of your nose, I promise.  The only 'chore' I didn't like was the one that had nothing to do with the ranch, though it was also fair. You do something for the lady at the shop, and she does something for you in return. I just wish it hadn't been so trying to collect all the arrowheads. Though here's a word to the wise: You can collect them at any time. So when you see one in the game, pick it up. That way you have less work later.  As a game, I'd highly recommend it to new comers to the series. It isn't my favorite, but that's mostly because my favorites, if you look at them, generally follow the same pattern (find secret passageways!). The story is beautiful, the 'dudes' are great (and so are the incriminating side stories that all three of them get), I loved riding on Bob (the horse), and it was just an all around good adventure-mystery.",138

Well that doesn't apply in this case, because I'm talking about a clean XP install vs. a clean Windows 7 install.  Previously we tried to make the laptop faster by installing XP from scratch.

7631.0,505,1.0,"I have the cheapest full Android phone that is available with no contract on the WalMart TMobile plan:  the Concord.  I am not putting specs, but if your phone is of a similar line, then you know who you are.  I was not able to install Kaspersky Lab Security for Android, because I did not have enough free memory on my phone.  I went through each application on my phone and deleted as many as I could, and I still couldn't install Kaspersky  I only got my phone about 4 months ago, so I would expect anything to run on it.  My version of the Android operating system is compatible with Kaspersky.  That is not the issue.  Instead, the issue is that Kaspersky wants more free memory.  And, I am unable to go on Kaspersky's website and find a full requirements for a phone.  The install process, in a perfect world would go as follows: -  You order this and get a card in the mail with the serial number for your license. -  The card tells you to and you type a URL on Kaspersky's website into your phone.  Then your phone downloads a file, but Kaspersky's website does not pop up any sort of confirmation message, so it's up to you to check downloads. -  You go to your downloaded file and try to run it. -  You get two options for how to run it:  through the Play Store, or from the file.  I tried the through the Play Store option and got nothing - no reaction from the phone.  I think tried from the file, and to do that, I had to turn off my phone's security setting which was set to not allow installing apps except from the Play Store (so that I can't just browse to a malware site and accidentally install software). -  Then, for me, my phone said not enough memory, free up memory.  So, I looked on my computer to try and find specs for phones to run this.  All I could find were ""Android 2.3 - 4.2"" and ""Minimum screen resolution 320 x 480"".  My phone has that.  What my phone is lacking is memory.  I opted to give up, rather than try to uninstall other apps or modify settings without knowing how much memory I had to free up. -  Rather than continuing the attempted install, I went back through my phone's security settings to not allow apps to install unless I get them from the Play Store.  Overall, if you have a high end newer speced out Android phone, you can probably count on Kaspersky installing.  If you are the unwashed masses, with a low end low specs Android phone, don't count on it.",1669

595.0,47,1.0,"There was a time long, long ago when I enjoy using my Macintosh.  Pleased with so fine a product, I bought many over the years.  Certainly OS X (Panther) has thrown a couple gigabytes of ice water on that romance.  But Panther has made one thing clear that never was before.  Previously I never could quite express what I enjoyed about the older Mac operating systems.  I can now.  Before, I could find things.  And I always knew where I was in the hierarchy of folders.  If I had a document in a folder, stored in a second folder that ordering was always transparent.  I could see the folders open, one inside the other.  And when I closed up, they slipped inside one another quite intuitively.  No more.  In OS X, I haven't a clue.  I do have a 750-page manual that I keep in my lap when working in Panther.  With a trembling finger on the step-by-step instructions and my other hand on the mouse, I can empty the trash successfully.  I know the red buttons close something-sometimes something I wanted closed, but more often my home window.  (Which I've learned to find after a brief but infuriating search.)  There are candy colored yellow and green buttons too though I can't say what they do just now.  It's all there somewhere in the manual, but before reaching for help try a little reason.  If the red pill closes a window, what would logic suggest about the functions of the yellow and green?  Don't bother; logic is no guide in Panther.  And that encapsulates the problem.  In OS X nothing makes much sense, intuition is of no value, everything must be memorized.  The claim is that OS X is bedrock stable.  Try to console yourself with that tradeoff the next time you face the spinning beach ball of death.  Hint: Erase your hard-drive and re-install everything.  A rock after all is a rock.  And don't get me started on the Dock.  I've read (several times) the twenty-page introduction that explains just how easy the Dock is to use.  I condensed all that to a half page of notes, which I've misplaced.  But the little icons do look nifty.  And they do bounce happily-like little corpses on deliberators.  In fact OS X has all the chrome gleam and high-tech awe of a modern hospital.  Yes it is wonderful how technology can keep a body alive on antibiotics, feeding tubes, and assisted breathing.  But remember how wonderful it once was to run free?  Effortlessly if memory serves, and without much pain.",427

2974.0,155,2.0,"I have been terribly disappointed with Office for Mac 2008 since Day 1.  When I first installed it and found that the (controversial) ribbon from Office 2007 for PC wasn't there, I felt like I had been cheated somehow.  However, as I used Office for Mac more, I found that the ribbon was the least of my worries.  I have two primary criticisms...  First, Office 2008 is exceedingly slow.  I have a 3.06GHz C2D iMac with 4Gb RAM and this is, without doubt, the slowest launching program I have.  Even after multiple updates, it's still 2-3x slower than Pages on first launch.  Furthermore, while using the program, actions like autocorrection, etc take almost a full second to implement, during which time Office stops responding graphically (it's actually working, just not displaying anything until it churns through the autocorrect, after which it ""speed types"" in what was in the buffer).  Second, the Thesaurus is also particularly disapppointing, since it doesn't seem to be able to sense the forms of words.  Many ""-ing"" words show their root in the thesaurus, which you then use to find a synonym and, after inserting, you have to go back and manually change the form.  Ridiculous.  Third, there appears to be a bug (perhaps related to the autocorrect lag) where changes to a document sometimes cause a ""visual corruption.""  It's difficult to explain, but an example would be where a significant amount of text is changed from double-space to singe-space.  After doing so, it is entirely possible to have a ""phantom"" sentence on the page that disappears if you scroll up then back down.  It's almost as if Word correctly moved everything, but forgot to update the screen to show the changes.  There are several other problems that I just don't have the heart to detail here (some of them are personal frustrations with design decisions).  The bottom line, however, is that this is the first Office suite in 15 years that I have wished I could ""unbuy.""  There are too many ""annoyances"" here.  It could be that I use documents between Office 2007 on a PC and 2008 on a Mac, but shouldn't there be 100% compatibility. Perhaps the 2011 version will be better, but for the time being, this is the single most frustrating piece of software I currently have on my iMac, primarily because I know how well it works on the PC side.

8032.0,529,5.0,"in broad terms, legal business Pro 2014, provides you with a framework and structure for you to hang your knowledge upon. I would not suggest that you rely upon this extensive library of contracts and forms if you have absolutely no knowledge of the law, or no experience with legal issues. That being said it is a first-class tool to use at state and federal level. The program itself is extraordinarily easy to install. The user agreement in the installation process is mildly amusing since it disavows any liability and recommends that you should consult a lawyer, and the extent of any liability for the company that puts out the legal business Pro software is just for the cost of the program. That piece of mild amusement (at least for anyone who has done contract law at university level) aside, the program provides updates as you start and continues, if you register, to provide additional updates for two years after 31st of December 2014; one of the bonuses of registration is a 404 page contract law book.   Once you start the program you have a whole list of resources including a library of legal books and even references to lawyers by category. When you start to create a document the program has a basic three-part interface: the first is create document. The second is read Nolo book from library. And the third is view checklist. A sizable amount of the forms that you can use are basically fill in the spaces type of documents, and for small businesses these will undoubtedly come in handy; about the only recommendation I would make is that wherever possible make sure that you have very good records, since (for example) a request for a bounced check to be honored, could quickly get to a small claims issue, and how something as simple as that is handled varies from state to state. The second reference to the library is probably going to be good for research for contracts, and finding cases with precedents where certain clauses are deemed enforceable, and certain closely worded ones are deemed not enforceable can usually be found in either case law or precedent books. In the more basic sense, the checklist in legal business Pro can help you through some easy things to sort out, as well as some moderately complex things to sort out. As good as this set of forms, contracts, and other references are in the legal realm, the biggest issue you will face, in my opinion, is the decision concerning when your own ability to handle issues is stretched to its limits, and it's time to call a lawyer. Still, it may be a big learning experience if you draft up a contract, whether agreement, lease, business related contract, and take it to a lawyer and see how far off the mark you might be. If you are halfway decent at researching you might actually find that you can draw up a contract that actually stands up to the test, and legal business Pro 2014 is definitely the set of tools to get you at least part of the way there.",463

3565.0,225,5.0,"A short history of upgrading the OS for MAC. When I upgraded from TIGER to Leopard X, the upgrade that was recommended essentially wiped my hard drive clean so after installation was complete, I had to reinstall my OFFICE for MAC and other programs.  Sometimes history does not repeat itself. Snow Leopard installed fully in approximately one hour. With little effort on my part the installation went flawlessly and no programs (or even icons) were lost in the process.  Once installed, users are not going to notice significant changes. Everything was the same as it was before (my Dock was still on the bottom, even my custom desktop screen was the same).  But when I checked the HD, I got a wonderful shock to discover that Snow Leopard gave me back almost a whopping 7 GB of space! I don't know how APPLE managed to get rid of the bloat without changing anything but Thanks!  Now my three year old Mac Book runs a little bit faster and has a lot more disk space.",369
7584.0,502,5.0,"I am excited about all of the unique features and effects Painter X3 offers as a piece of graphics software. There are things that can be done in Painter X3 that I have not been able to do with any other graphics program.  Painter X3 is not the type of software that a new user can just immediately jump into, because of the special capabilities that it provides. However, it does not take long to understand the intricacies which separate it from basic illustration software. The first thing I noticed when I jumped into it were the alerts that the layer I was working on did not work with the brush I was using, so I made ""Layers"" the first section of the online User's Guide that I would read. It quickly became apparent what the purpose is of the three different types of layers, so I feel I chose well. Once my understanding of layer properties was obtained, the rest of the program became easily understandable, and I have been progressing through the guide in order since, and loving what this program can accomplish.  Special brushes produce amazing effects. Existing surface paint colors can be combined and dragged with new colors, or they can be excluded from the effects of a new stroke when on a separate layer. The build-up effect of subsequent brush strokes produces an excitingly traditional look. An extensive list of effects options for the Impasto brushes allows for some astonishingly stunning, real-world effects, as well.  Navigating a canvas takes a bit of getting used to when one is accustomed to dragging the canvas around the screen without specifically choosing a move option, but there is reasoning behind it, while manipulating the red view rectangle within the thumbnail image in the preview pane provides a quickly accessible means to make up for any extra step that would be necessary in the workspace view.  For users who experienced what they felt was a drastic change in Painter X2, the upgrade to Painter X3 refines some of those changes, making for a simpler, more efficient workflow, while adding several cool new features, as well.  Corel Painter X3 can be used with a mouse, but it is most efficient when used in conjunction with a pressure-sensitive drawing tablet. Not only will it be easier to express the subtleties of light and heavy strokes, but also users will have much more convenient control over the smoothness and the angles of their brushstrokes.  I love Corel Painter X3. It is possible to come across some instructions in the User's Guide that do not reflect the current Painter X3 environment, but these are subtle items, which are easily identified upon their discovery. Painter X3 is a powerful, unique and fun real-media graphics tool that I am happy to have at my command. I highly recommend Corel Painter X3 for designers, illustrators, artists and hobbyists of all kinds.",1035
1055.0,79,5.0,"This is a terrific little set of applications.  If it had only been GarageBand it would have been worth the modest cost.  GarageBand is a sturdy, multispectrum, easy to use multi track recording studio.  Its predecessor was pretty basic - but the new version is a substantial update.  The user interface is simpler and more straight forward.  I can now utilize all of the outputs on my mixer (earlier versions limited me to a few at a time).  The loop record function allows me to overdub again and again as I practice a riff - the stacked riffs can be isolated, and cut/pasted into the final mix with remarkable ease.  There is a basic but formidable set of effects, including a very passable compressor, a great limiter to maximize volume without sacrificing quality, almost unlimited mixing capabilities. But its not just GarageBand - the new iPhoto is a tremendous improvement as well.  I've seen some critical reviews stating that having the library available only within the application is a hassle.  Its actually not.  Its easy enough to sidestep this in any of several ways - import the photos to a separate file before adding them to the iPhoto library - you can then import them into iPhoto from their folders, but here's the benefit! If the drive you import the files to is different from the one you have the iPhoto library on, well then you have just created a backup for the photos.  Its always a good idea too to burn a CD or DVD with those images in case of a system or hardware crash!  I love the new ""events"" feature.  It is so easy to keep track of images now - being able to preview all the images in an event without opening its library is a great time saver.  And I love the interactivity with the internet - I've posted a few web galleries directly from iPhoto - they look great and so far everyone I've invited to look has been impressed both with how easily the galleries work and how stable and fast the are. iMovie works wonderfully - although I've upgraded and purchased Final Cut Express 8 - iMovie is great for rough cuts, but FCE offers much more diverse tools for polishing! iWeb is a limited but functional website builder - it lacks the diversity and flexibility of GoLive or Dreamweaver, but then I don't always have the time or the energy to use those applications for very basic informational webbing. And finally, iDVD does exactly what its supposed to. I think that is the critical point about all the Apple applications I own - FinalCut Express, Logic Express, iLife and iWork, OSX Leopard.  They do exactly what they advertise, and do it well.  If you have an Apple machine that meets the hardware standards (read that last line again!) then you can't go wrong with these applications!  Once you've bought iLife, make sure to watch the short but helpful training videos on the Apple website.  It will jumpstart your usage!",85
8897.0,572,3.0,"Streaming, the Cloud, downloading--is it helping the music, the musicians, the listeners?  Or is it simply a hugely popular, entrenched novelty for gadgeteers who think that Bluetooth audio in every room (and car) is ""kinda cool""?  Negatives: 1. The compressed signal is measureably inferior to the non-compressed .aiff or .wav files of commercial CDs--from 1/8 to 1/5th the amount of ""audio information"" contained within the frequencies received. 2. The files also cheat the inquisitive listener of much vital information--from recording artists to engineers to biographical and contextual matters to personnel on the recording to descriptions that help the listener ""understand"" the music; 3. the concept of a ""unified album,"" which is as vital to a Sinatra album as to the movements of a Beethoven symphony or Bach chorale, is massacred--parted out into a cyberspatial junkyard; 4. the public is becoming less knowledgeable about the ""classics"" of not just symphonic and ""classical music but jazz and the American popular song as a result of tracks played willy-nilly for neophytes' bemusement; 5. the ubiquitous streaming is erasing not only history but distinctions vital to an art--all music becomes, in effect, ""smooth jazz,"" relegated to the background.  Positives: 1. A few remaining commercial record companies with good lawyers are making out very well with the present arrangement; 2. owners of copyrights are able to enjoy royalties and restrict use of their songs--even to the extent of shutting-down Wikiphonia, a musician-based source of musical literature that was not merely a necessity for financially-challenged musicians but a means of keeping alive ""the Great American Songbook.""  Instead, those songs are limited to the elite few, and musicians can obtain copies of them at $4 per page (a musician is lucky to make $40 playing a 4-hour job--requiring him to bring his own piano!  (There are no lawyers to represent the interests and needs of the musicians and the art itself--only the rights of the ""property"" owners.  The many thousands of dollars Sony invested in the near-miraculous restoration of ""Duke Ellington at Newport 1956"" will no longer be ""wasted"" on the remastering of a ""mere CD.""  If technology is uncontrollable, then Amazon appears to make the most music available for the least cost.  And their playlists are easier to find and play on an iPod or iPhone than those created in iTunes, especially since the introduction of the intrusive ""entrapment,"" or subscription service, called Apple Music.  Yet an iTunes user is likely to find the iTunes Store the surest and quickest way to purchase a single track and to locate it after it's been downloaded.  I've read elsewhere about an Amazon Music subscription service--at a cost of less than five bucks per month.  But I can't find it!  Whereas Apple Music is hard to steer clear off; Amazon Music seems unfindable (perhaps I already have it and don't know.)  The catalogs and prices of Apple and Amazon downloads are so similar as to be unworthy of comparison.  It's the convenience and accuracy of downloading that count most.  Apple has recently upgraded its OS to Sierra, and again Amazon downloads are slow to appear in my iTunes program.  But appear they do.  By contrast, eMusic--which originally allowed the user as many tracks as he desired for a flat low fee--has made it virtually impossible to stay the course.  For all of 2016 my downloads--for which I pay a monthly fee entitling me to download at half Apple's and Amazon's prices--are simply not to be found.  The company has responded with detailed instructions, but it's at the point of misdirected labor and time for little to no return.  None of the downloads appears anywhere on my computer.  Moreover, eMusic no longer stores my music, allowing me ""free"" re-downloading of the files I've previously downloaded.  iTunes allows me to ""re-download"" a previously purchased file; I can only surmise that Amazon does the same.  As a Mac owner and iTunes user, it's inevitable that there will be some confusion. At this point I either need to download and print out all of the info Amazon has published about use of their service or purchase a manual (preferably costing no more than ten).  On the other hand, I may just sit back and enjoy my mostly ""hard-copy"" record collection, spending any available funds on dusting off my LPs and getting my old turntable up to speed.",540

1643.0,120,4.0,"I've been using Symantec/Norton security software exclusively on all my PCs and Macs for at least a decade. This review pertains to the PC/Windows environment only.  Over the past few years I had been noticing system slowdowns that seemed to be related to things like auto-download and installation of frequent updates of virus definitions. I figured that's the price I'd have to pay to keep my PC and data safe. I've been reading over the past year or two, though, that McAfee users seemed to feel the software and updates didn't bog down Windows (XP) as much.  After installing this software via the included CD (I much prefer buying software online these days...personal preference), I did a few startup tests to note extra delays (McAfee definitely loaded faster); virus scans to monitor speed (no viruses here, fortunately), and made sure to monitor an online update/download while my PC was running 4 or 5 other applications, the way I usually work. I heard some disk activity but barely noticed a slowdown in the other processes.  I'm going to stick with it for a while, especially since this comes as a 3-user pack, but I hate the idea of wasting the 200+ more days of Norton virus updates I already paid for. Also, the McAfee scans did drive home the welcome realization that the Norton/Symantec software I had been running was doing its job pretty darn well. On the other hand, I'm certainly willing to change at this point.  I think what I'll do is run McAfee for a while on my main desktop machine and Norton on my main laptop. We'll see if a change is in order...or whether it really matters one way or the other.",690

5608.0,376,4.0,"I have been testing and recommending anti-virus software since the mid 90s.  At that time McAfee was the best there was.  This is no longer true.  In my opinion the best current anti virus product is ESET NOD32.  I recently tested McAfee 2012 vs Kaspersky 2011 (and Kaspersky 2012).  On testing a scan of one partition McAfee reported that it scanned 51,221 files and took one and a half hours to do it.  On the same partition Kaspersky (minor differences between the 2011 version and 2012 version) reported that it tested 779,264 files and took one hour and five minutes.  McAfee 2012 consumes 86 MB of memory (""private bytes"") and 412 MB of virtual memory. Kaspersky 2012 uses 195 MB of memory (""private bytes"") and 596 MB of virtual memory.  Kaspersky 2011 was slightly nicer in that it reported the elapsed time to do a scan, the new version 2012 only reports when the scan finished.  Kaspersky's install is well done and impressive as it detected and removed traces of McAfee which were left behind after McAfee was uninstalled.  Kaspersky has one very valuable feature a ""rescue disk"" (a bootable disk which you can use for a clean scan of an infected system) which neither ESET nor McAfee provide.

9573.0,610,3.0,">>>  Note: See update below on the M* XRay feature.  It's neither as bad as the detractors say, nor as good as the fans rave.  As long-time Quicken users know, each year Intuit adds the bare minimum to justify calling the software new, there aren't major improvements.  (I think they have a 2 week period where they pull a few developers from other projects and say ""Ok, let's do the new Quicken release!"")  But it works, as far as that goes.  The limitations mostly remain, I'm not going to list my own grumbles here, there's no point in that, the company has no incentive to attend to those.  I upgrade every 2-3 years, because I have to -- I want the downloads to work, and I want the bug fixes.  So I held my nose and bought this year's version (nice to get the Prime discount from Amazon).  It installed fine, although it seemed to take a long time in the middle while creating the qw.exe file.  Conversions of the old files (I have several, some quite huge) were free of error and trouble, and I was able to delight in the new software that was just like the old.  Note:  I chose to keep my old vault password, rather than doing their cloud thing.  Also, I didn't like the mobile software when I tried it some months ago, so avoided that completely this time.  Probably helped me avoid some problems that others have reported.  The Morningstar X-Ray feature?  Not nearly as complete as the feature you get from M* Premium, but that costs a lot more than Quicken does, so one really can't complain -- it's a pretty nice feature you get for ""free"".  I wish that there were better integration with M*, so Premium members could upload from Quicken and then go to the M* website to do the more detailed analysis & reporting.  The credit score feature?  This seems to be the year's new gimmick.  I get the FICO score from one of my credit cards (free), and the TransUnion score (also free) from another one.  Quicken gives you the Equifax score.  (Someone is offering the Experian score, but I can't remember who that is.)  I decided I didn't trust Intuit enough to share my credit history with them, so I passed.  It's not going to improve my life to know what Equifax says.  Other improvements?  Reporting's the same -- terrible.  Investment transaction handling? Still pretty basic.  You get the picture.  Same old, same old.  ============ Update:  Oct 31, 2014  The ""Portfolio X-Ray"" feature appears to be unreliable ...  Today I decided to take another look at what the XRay report was telling me, figuring it would be easier/faster than putting all the data into my Morningstar Premium portfolio manager.  At first I was a little puzzled because the report just seemed to be reporting incorrect information.  So I made sure I selected the right accounts and securities, and refreshed the report.  (It takes a while, sometimes just hangs.)  Still incorrect.  And not minor differences: the bond holding percentage was incorrect, as was the average mutual fund expense ratio.  After some further investigation, I figured out that Quicken isn't correctly submitting the full list of holdings, it's apparently leaving some out -- I noticed that some closed-end funds are missing, for instance.  I can't tell what else is missing, since there isn't a detailed securities list. (Now don't tell me  CEFs are unsupported, they're not that exotic.)  So there you go.  Both the great new features aren't quite what they're cracked up to be.",974
9048.0,579,5.0,"As someone new to video editing, I found Video Studio X7 to be very helpful. The tutorials are great for getting you started, and the FastFlick option is a very easy way to help create your first videos. Using FastFlick, the program walks you through the process, and it's just a quick 3 steps to create your video using template options. It makes creating a video very easy to follow - especially while you're learning the program.  After a little use, I still like FastFlick for creating quick simple videos, but the additional flexibility and customization available through the regular video creation is also fantastic. Including titles, credits or subtitles is very simple, and the Capture studio allows you to film video to edit in the program directly from your webcam or compatible camera.  The stop-motion studio is very useful as well, and super easy to use. It likewise can be utilized through the Capture studio, using your webcam or camera to input images into the program as you take each picture. It even has an ""onion skin"" feature, allowing you to see a see-through copy of your previous picture overlapping your next one, so you can easily line up your pictures for good stop-motion flow.  All in all, a very useful program, and pretty easy to use even for a beginner.",1164
10442.0,660,1.0,"well, I bought the H&R Block and am extremely unhappy with it. I found a major glitch in the interview that would affect a lot of people that aren't knowledgeable about taxes. first I had major problems with the install, I assume a bad disk. it wouldn't boot directly from the disk and kept saying try again. I finally had to use MY COMPUTER and after a few try's got it to load. the desktop icon is just a green square which could be a glitch and between everything makes me not trust the validity of the disk. the interview is terrible compared to TT and a major flaw I found that in putting in a social security 1099 it doesn't ask you for the Medicare amounts paid and doesn't pinpoint it at any part of the interview even when you get to medical insurance for the schedule A. I found the interview overall extremely lacking. the forms view truly sucks and they incorporate worksheets into the form making too much clutter and confusion. going back to TT since intuit is making good on their screw up. Been a TT customer since the mid 90's. Block is OK, but so was TT ten years ago, Block is way behind in working out the kinks  REVISION  found two major glitches, already returned it and bought TT. DON'T TRUST IT  Medicare deduction for medical  has to be manually added TT asks for info off of SSA-1099  didn't carry over proper state income tax refund info, told me my refund was not taxable. took me two hours of comparing between the two programs to find the mistake",1727

11955.0,762,3.0,"I really wanted this to be a great program. I have separate video, and music software as well as Photoshop, Corel, vector imaging software, etc, so basically, I have pretty much everything I need to do what this software does, but better. I was hoping that this software would make it easier having most of it all in one program. Unfortunately, this software didn't deliver. I think the only imaging software that I don't have, and would give my right arm for, is QuarkXpress.  I think this might be a good program for a beginner. For me, I think they would be better off concentrating on doing one thing very well rather than several things half as well. I tried to install this on my Windows 7 computer and it wouldn't install. It installed fine on my Windows 10 machine even though I didn't want to install it on that computer. The price for this software isn't too bad, though, for what it does.",1795

So don't know about the others, but take a pass on this forever.  I do IT and can only imagine the hours people have burned AFTER installing this package and not realizing it was the cause of other issues.  Good luck.",804

6282.0,417,2.0,"Yes, I own Fix-It, which I received through the Amazon Vine program.  However, after reading all the negative reviews of this software, I decided not to chance trying it. Thanks, but I have had enough of Blue Screen Death to last a life time. Admittedly, that's more a problem caused by Windows than by virus and malware software, but any software that causes it as often as this one seems to do must be problematic.  I have a laptop that had blue screen issues a few years ago, but after obtaining a new hard drive and new virus software --- none of the major brands --- that system has worked fine. I use it seldom, and would like to preserve it for those rare times I travel and must have a functioning PC with me.  Fix It sounds like it would cause more trouble than it solves.  When a computer virus and trouble-shooting program begins to guarantee that it will replace the computer if it is destroyed during installation or use, that's when I'll try Fix It!

116.0,8,3.0,"I have used ""Instant Immersion Spanish Levels 1,2 & 3"" for several months now and it is a complete Spanish language program that can teach basic words and conversational Spanish, but it does require a significant commitment to be made by the user. You get a lot with this set but the quality of the content varies greatly from disc to disc. The program includes, in recommended order of use:  1) An MP3 Audio CD - This teaches the basic vocabulary and phrases. It can also be downloaded onto an iPod.  The main learning programs follow and need to be installed to run. These include lessons, games, and allow for downloading elements to an iPod - 2) Level 1, Disc 1 (Talk Now) CD-ROM 3) Level 1, Disc 2 (Vocabulary Builder) CD-ROM 4) Level 2, Disc 1 (Talk More) CD-ROM 5) Level 2, Disc 2 (Talk the Talk) CD-ROM 6) Level 3, Disc 1 (World Talk) CD-ROM 7) Level 3, Disc 2 (Business Talk) CD-ROM  8) ""Talk More"" Interactive DVD - This is basically an overview that includes basic phrases and quizzes, but is hard to navigate 9) ""Who is Oscar Lake"" CD-ROM Game - This is an actual PC game that plays like one of the popular mystery games (i.e. Nancy Drew, etc)  The Audio CD and PC Game feel like they were added as extras since they don't really match the rest of the class.  I deducted rating stars because of the clumsy feel of the games, the user recording without verification (something other programs support), and lack of a cohesive lesson plan.  I had two years of Spanish in High School (almost 30 years ago), so this program was a much needed refresher. In addition, my daughter has just finished her 3rd year of High School Spanish and she went through some of the program (and game play) with me. We both agree that while this program (and likely those similar to it) will teach you the basic words and phrases, nothing will let you develop and retain a second language unless you actually use it with native speakers on a regular basis.  This program does give you a lot for the price so it is a good value but as another reviewer points out, learning another language is harder as you get older! Start early and good luck!  CFH",107
6275.0,417,4.0,"This collection of mainentence software utilities is quick, easy and seemingly effective. Easy to install, it detects preexisting virus protection and gives you the option to use it or theirs.  The utilities are divided into three separate catgfories:  Security, Optimise and Fix and Maintain.  Security lets you set up different types of scans and set up block list.  Optimize has a fast disk defrag tool among others.  Fix and Maintain deals with system restore and file recovery and a scheduler for automatic maintenence. The company also provided a rather thick owner's manual which I appreciated.  I don't know that the scans are quicker than my previous system but the computer is running significantly faster.  The One Click Fix is sufficient for the average user but I like that there are options for those more technically adept.  The cost is reasonable and the scope is comprehensive. Recommended.",1513
4058.0,268,3.0,"My review title/subject is supposed to be a bit of a play on Microsoft's ad campaign ""I'm a PC"" as I most regularly am a PC user, but just because that's my normal world, don't assume that I don't know the Mac world.  You see, I have both Mac's and PC's in my home, and at various times may use either depending upon my mood and/or whether it seems that I've not used one system enough lately (so that it's batteries get charged/discharged enough to keep them useful, etc.)  With that said, I do admit that my primary realm is that of Windows PC's, and not so much the Mac.  I have a lovely little Macbook that I keep up-to-date with patches and system upgrades, and again, on more than the odd occasion I pull out the Macbook and enjoy using it to surf through my regular stomping grounds.  Doing so lets me stay familiar with the Mac and gives me a chance to see some sites with slightly different results (when, for example, a site renders better in one browser than another).  In any case, I saw an opportunity to check out the Smart Surfing for Mac software by Trend Micro and opted to see what the experience of installing 'security software' on the Mac is like compared to doing the same thing on a PC.  On a PC, again, as hinted at in some of the commercials we've been bombarded with (this time from the Apple side), surfing the web without protection of some sort is a very dangerous proposition.  There are too many vulnerabilities that can be taken advantage of if the computer user (PC user) hasn't kept their system updated and patched.  Regardless, those words shouldn't be taken to mean that in reality Mac's or *nix based systems are less vulnerable to malware as all systems have vulnerabilities, but because so many computer systems in use in the world are 'PC's' the PC world presents a bigger target and offers people like me much more opportunity to be familiar with internet security software.  Mac's have their share of vulnerabilities including vulnerabilities due to third party software (Adobe, Sun JAVA, etc.) and even the underlying software.  Because of that, it's still a very good idea to have internet security software installed on your system, no matter what software you prefer.  Which brings us back to the purpose of this particular review, the Trend Smart Surfing for Mac software, and whether or not it should be your software of choice in this area.  Now, I must admit, I don't have the familiarity with the choices of software packages that are available on a Mac.  On a PC I could probably name a half dozen internet security/anti-malware packages without even thinking about it.  With a few minutes thought I could probably add another half dozen, and with a few minutes to search the web I'd probably find another dozen that I just couldn't remember when I was under pressure.  On a Mac the list of software that I'm aware of is much, much smaller, to the point of being nearly non-existent.  I count that as my own fault, and beg your indulgence, as the list of programs I've actually used for this purpose (on a Mac at least) is in the neighborhood of 2 (which I won't bother naming here).  One was open source software and another was a commercial program provided by my employer for employees to use on their systems.  The open source software was a very simple program to install and was equally easy to remove/uninstall.  The commercial software was a bit more difficult to figure out how to uninstall and that threw me for a bit of loop, compliments of the installer for the Trend Smart Surfing for the Mac product.  The installer for the Trend Smart Surfing product will insist that any existing security software be uninstalled, but, in a more than irritating flaw (in my book) the installer doesn't tell you what product it has found that needs to be removed.  It would be very, very helpful to open an install log that notes the software that was found as doing so would help the user find out what they need to do if they wish to remove the old product and proceed with this one.  Eventually I got past the issue once I found the uninstall command script that I needed to run to remove the originally installed product.  I'd swear that in the past installs and uninstalls of software on the Mac were basically a case of dragging and dropping the installed software onto the system or into the recycle bin, but that wasn't at all the case with my old security software.  Ugh.  While this isn't really the fault of the Trend Smart Surfing product, I note that the Trend product's install disc showed a menu choice for 'Uninstall' in it's menu and that leaves me thinking that apparently I'm going to have to keep the CD/DVD handy well into the future just so I can put it back into the system and use that option when I'm ready to remove the product (if that ever happens).  I'm guessing there's probably some uninstall scripts that can be downloaded and used if needed, but I hope not to ever need to find that out, or at least hope not to find it out when I'm in a very frustrated state :-/  Once I removed the existing software the installer proceeded normally and the software installed itself just fine, up to the point that it was supposed to be registered.  At that point, Firefox (my default browser at the time) opened and refused to open the destination web site because, uh, the site certificate for the destination site was invalid.  What?!!?  Oops!  I guess Trend Micro forgot to update the certificate for that site, but that doesn't necessarily inspire confidence in the vendor, no?  Beyond those issues I'd have to complain a little about the packaging.  The contents of the package are a small quick reference card (approx. 6 pages if you count it's cover), folded in thirds.  The folded page size is a bit bigger than that of a CD/DVD, but in reality it seems that the quick reference card could easily be resized into one that would fit easily into a more environmentally friendly CD/DVD sized case.  In addition to the quick reference card there's the disc that comes in a paper envelope with a label on the back that provides you with the required serial number.  Ok, not so bad in that area, but again, be sure to keep that number/case and disc handy well into the future.  That's it.  That's what in the box, which inspires the question of why is there a box?  A box with a bunch of empty space in it.  Totally unnecessary packaging which seems silly and wasteful.  I would note that the box features a 'Printed on Recycled Paper' logo which is encouraging, but it still seems unnecessary as a CD sized package (like an Audio CD) would easily do the job.  On the software product itself, it seems adequate and seems to be working, but in reality, as a fairly careful web surfer (I know, we all make typo's every now and then and wind up going to sites we didn't intend, and/or we get sent to sites that aren't what we expected after we've executed a web search) I don't tend to be going to sites that would set off alarms and opening dialog boxes questioning whether or not I wish to continue (and potentially damage my own system).  I want internet security software that works, but is not intrusive.  If the software gets in my way, it'll get turned off and become totally useless.  The big question is whether or not the software is worth the purchase price?  Despite the impression that some people have of Mac owners, I don't personally know Mac users that happily toss their money away on either hardware or software.  Just because Mac owners pay more for a quality computing product, that doesn't mean they want to keep doing that when it comes to additional software that they'll install on their systems.  Any way, in the case of the Trend Smart Surfing for Mac the product seems to deliver value at a reasonable level.  Not an overwhelming value, but a reasonable value for the product's sale price.  If you don't go with this product, please do understand that I heartily encourage any computer user that will ever connect their system to the internet or any other computer system to run anti-malware software on their systems.  Security is only as good as the weakest link in the chain and that weak link should not be YOU!",1007
